    <h1>Using the Default VR Juggler Simulator Mode</h1>


This document describes the basics of how to interact with VR Juggler's
simulator displays and devices.  It is important to remember that Juggler
is highly configurable, and that the specifics of the discussion here apply
to the default simulator configuration files shipped with VR Juggler.
<p>
The best way to find out how a specific configuration file is set up is to
look at it in vjcontrol.  In particular, look in Input/Simulated Devices
to see which keyboard windows the simulated devices are hooked up to and how
they respond to key presses and mouse movements.


<h2>The Simulator Config Files</h2>
Juggler ships with four configuration files which, together, provide a
complete simulation of an immersive environment.  These files are found in
<TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/Data/configFiles</TT> and should have been copied into your
<TT>~/.vjconfig</TT> directory.  The simulator files are:

<p>
<PRE>
        sim.base.config
        sim.wand.mixin.config
        sim.glove.mixin.config
        sim.analog.mixin.config
</PRE>
<p>

<TT>sim.base.config</TT> is the base config file for simulator mode (big
surprise, huh?).  It contains most of the configuration needed to start up
a Juggler app.  It also defines two simulator display windows - a little one
that's active by default, and a larger one that's initially inactive
(that can be changed by editing the file or by dynamically reconfiguring
an application with vjcontrol).

<p>
A Simulator Display is a special kind of VR Juggler display.  Instead of
basing its viewpoint on the head position of one of the users, it is 
controlled by a separate ``camera'' - which is just another positional
device.  The Sim Display also draws certain objects to help visualize the
environment.  For example, the heads of users are represented as 
blue spheres with gray eyes, and the wand is drawn as a green cone.  Also,
Surface Displays - Juggler Displays representing projection screens -
are drawn in the environment as translucent rectangles.

<p>
<TT>sim.wand.mixin.config</TT> sets up a simulated 3-button wand, and
is designed to be used with a base config file.  Actually, 
<tt>sim.base.config</tt> currently requires a wand to be defined.  The
real reason this is a separate file is that we occasionally find it useful
to use a simulated wand with real displays, or vice versa, for testing.

<p>
<tt>sim.glove.mixin.config</tt> sets up a simulated glove device.  You
only need to include this config file if your application expects to find
a glove. 

<p>
<tt>sim.analog.mixin.config</tt> sets up a small input window for controlling
analog devices.  You only need to include this config file if your 
application expects to find analog devices.  This config file requires
that the <TT>sim.wand.mixin.config</TT> also be loaded.


<h2>Starting the Application</h2>

To start an application in simulator mode, simply give the base and mixin
config files you want to use as command-line arguments.  For example, to 
run the ``<TT>cubes</tt>'' test program:

<pre>
     cubes ~/.vjconfig/sim.base.config ~/.vjconfig/sim.wand.mixin.config
</pre>

When the application starts up, it opens several windows.  The small
window labeled ``<TT>SimWindow1</TT>'' shows a view of the application.
You should be able to see the user's head, a wand, and -- if you're 
running cubes -- a bunch of little cubes floating in space.  The
other windows off to the side are keyboard input windows, used to
control the simulated input devices.  You should see windows labeled
``<TT>Head Keyboard</TT>'', ``<TT>Sim View Camera Control</TT>'', and
``<TT>Wand Keyboard</TT>''.  The base config also sets up another
display window - ``<TT>SimWindow2</TT>'' - but doesn't open it unless
you go into the configuration and activate it.

<h2>Head and Camera Movement in Simulator Mode</h2>

To move the user's head, select the ``<TT>Head Keyboard</TT>'' window
and use the numeric keypad.  The controls are:

<pre>
    KEY              MOVES
   -------------------------
    8                Forward
    2                Back
    4                Left
    6                Right
    9                Up
    7                Down
    CTRL-4           Turn Left
    CTRL-6           Turn Right
    CTRL-8           Look Down
    CTRL-2           Look Up
    3                Tilt Clockwise
    1                Tilt CCW
</pre>

The camera positions in <TT>SimDisplay1</TT> and <TT>SimDisplay2</TT>
are controlled by a pair of position simulator devices attached to the
``<TT>Sim View Camera Control</TT>'' window.  Their controls are as
follows (yes, <TT>SimCamera1</TT> is set up pretty much the same as the
Head Position):

<pre>
    KEY              MOVES
   -------------------------
    8                SimCamera1 Forward
    2                SimCamera1 Back
    4                SimCamera1 Left
    6                SimCamera1 Right
    9                SimCamera1 Up
    7                SimCamera1 Down
    CTRL-4           SimCamera1 Turn Left
    CTRL-6           SimCamera1 Turn Right
    CTRL-8           SimCamera1 Look Down
    CTRL-2           SimCamera1 Look Up
    3                SimCamera1 Tilt Clockwise
    1                SimCamera1 Tilt CCW

    SHIFT-8          SimCamera2 Forward
    SHIFT-2          SimCamera2 Back
    SHIFT-4          SimCamera2 Left
    SHIFT-6          SimCamera2 Right
    SHIFT-9          SimCamera2 Up
    SHIFT-7          SimCamera2 Down
    ALT-4            SimCamera2 Turn Left
    ALT-6            SimCamera2 Turn Right
    ALT-8            SimCamera2 Look Down
    ALT-2            SimCamera2 Look Up
    SHIFT-3          SimCamera2 Tilt Clockwise
    SHIFT-1          SimCamera2 Tilt CCW
</pre>

<h2>Using the Wand</h2>

For the wand, we've tried something a little different in our default
configuration: mouse control.  When the ``<TT>Wand Keyboard</TT>''
window is selected, mouse movements are translated into wand movements.
Here's how it works:

<ul>
<li>The mouse buttons, from left to right, correspond to wand buttons
0 through 2 (VJButton0-2).  Note that the buttons only work when no
modifier keys (<TT>CTRL, ALT, SHIFT</TT>) are pressed.
<li>Hold down a <TT>CTRL</TT> key and move the mouse.  Left-right movement is 
translated into left-right movement of the wand; forward-back movement
is translated into up-down.
<li>Hold down an <TT>ALT</TT> key and move the mouse.  Forward-back movement is
translated into forward-back movement of the wand.
<li>Hold down the <TT>SHIFT</TT> key and move the mouse to rotate the wand left
or right or tilt it up or down.
</ul>

<h2>Using the Glove</h2>

If you include the <TT>sim.glove.mixin.config</TT> file, your application
will also have access to a simulated glove, with position and gesture 
inputs.  The glove is controlled by the ``<TT>Glove Keyboard</TT>'' window.
This window lets you control the glove position and selected gesture.
Movement control of the glove uses the mouse and is the same as that of the wand.
The mouse buttons are used to select gestures.
The mapping of the gesture numbers to actual hand positions is controlled
by the Training File - for the sim glove, it defaults to 
<TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/Data/gesture/simpleSimGestures.dat</TT>.



<h2>Using the Analog Devices</h2>

If you include the <TT>sim.analog.mixin.config</TT> file, your application
will also have access to a set of four analog devices - devices with a
value in a range from 0 to 255.  The analog devices are also controlled
using the ``<TT>Wand Keyboard</TT>'' window - that's why their config file
requires the wand config file.  They keypresses used for controlling the
analog devices are:

<PRE>
    KEY              ACTION
   -------------------------
    Q                VJAnalog0 increase
    A                VJAnalog0 decrease
    W                VJAnalog1 increase
    S                VJAnalog1 decrease
    E                VJAnalog2 increase
    D                VJAnalog2 decrease
    R                VJAnalog3 increase
    F                VJAnalog3 decrease
</PRE>

If you aren't using a QWERTY keyboard, you'll probably want to change those
to something more intuitive.

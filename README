2. Questions about VR Juggler
==============================================================================

    As with most open source projects, there is a common path to follow
    for getting answers to questions.  The first step is to look at the
    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page on the web site.  If you do
    not find an answer there, refer to the detailed documentation.  If
    that too fails, send your question to the appropriate mailing list
    to get an answer from someone else in the VR Juggler community.

    C. Mailing lists

         i. vrjuggler-info

             General VR Juggler questions should be sent to the
             vrjuggler-info@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.  This is a
             general discussion and announcement list that usually does not
             have a lot of technical content.

        ii. vrjuggler-devel

            VR Juggler developer questions and questions relating to
            complex and/or technical details should be sent to the
            vrjuggler-devel@lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.

3. Compiling VR Juggler from source
==============================================================================

    For a detailed description of this process, please refer to
    http://www.vrjuggler.org/html/juggler.team.guide/build/juggler/index.html
    before sending email to the mailing lists.

    A. Overview

          i. Choose a directory to put the VR Juggler source code
         ii. Go to that directory and checkout VR Juggler using CVS
        iii. Enter the newly checked out Juggler source directory
         iv. Compile VR Juggler (using the Autoconf system and GNU make)

              a. Generate header template and configure script
              b. Probe the system for capabilities, generate Makefiles,
                 etc. (this configures the source tree for the current
                 system)
              c. Make the distribution using GNU make

          v. Set the environment variable $VJ_BASE_DIR
         iv. Compile applications

    B. Details

       NOTE: If you are reading this file, then you probably already have
       the VR Juggler source code and can skip to step iv (Compiling VR
       Juggler).

          i. Choose a directory to put the VR Juggler source code
             (referred to as <JUGGLER_DIR> from now on).

         ii. Go to that directory and checkout VR Juggler using CVS.  Of
             course, if you are reading this, you probably already have
             the source code, so this step can be skipped.
             NOTE: Make sure CVS is set up and pointing to the VR Juggler
             repository.  For more information about this, see the
             following page:

    http://www.vrjuggler.org/html/juggler.team.guide/build/get.source.html

            The simple (very incomplete) version is:

                cd <JUGGLER_DIR>
                cvs checkout -rRELENG_1_0 juggler_1.0

        iii. Enter the newly checked-out Juggler source directory

                cd <JUGGLER_DIR>/juggler_1.0

         iv. Compile VR Juggler (using the Autoconf system and GNU make)

              a. Generate header template (vjDefines.h.in) and the
                 configure script

                    autoheader
                    autoconf

              b. Probe the system for capabilities, generate Makefiles, etc.
                 (this configures the source tree for the current system)

                    ./configure

              c. Make the distribution using GNU make.  This compiles, links,
                 and creates the final distribution tree (in the form of
                 symlinks)

                    gmake

          v. Set the environment variable $VJ_BASE_DIR.  This is *required*
             by VR Juggler's application makefiles and runtime environment.

             NOTES:
                 1. The directory "instlinks" is semi-important. 
                    It is a working distribution of the VR Juggler library.
                    After "gmake" is done, you'll be able to use this
                    directory to compile and link your application code.
                    This will not work on Win32, so a full installation
                    must be performed.
                 2. It is helpful to have something similar to the following
                    line your $HOME/.tcshrc or $HOME/.cshrc file (assuming
                    the use of tcsh for your shell):

                        setenv VJ_BASE_DIR [JUGGLER_DIR]/juggler_1.0/instlinks

                    Use whatever is appropriate for your shell (BASH, ksh,
                    DOS, etc.)

    C. Advanced topics

       Sending compiler output to a different directory than the source
       tree can be helpful for debugging and development.  This is done
       by making a directory to put the object files and compiled
       libraries before building.

       The following steps set up a build directory within your VR Juggler
       source directory.  Here, we use the name <BUILD_DIR> to refer to
       the directory that will contain the object files and libraries.  It
       can be called whatever you want.

           mkdir <JUGGLER_DIR>/juggler_1.0/<BUILD_DIR>
           cd <JUGGLER_DIR>/juggler_1.0/<BUILD_DIR>
           <JUGGLER_DIR>/juggler_1.0/configure

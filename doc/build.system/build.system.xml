      <title>Software Choreography</title>

      <para>Within this book, we present the fundamentals of the VR Juggler
      2.0 build system, a complex piece of software in its own right that
      manages the compilation of the various modules that make up VR Juggler
      2.0 (and beyond, I suspect). Those few readers who may be familiar with
      the VR Juggler 1.0 build system may recognize a few similarities, but
      truly, the Doozer++-based build is quite different than what was
      originally intended to be backwards compatible with an IRIX-only build
      written for the first version of VR Juggler (then called VRLib).</para>

      <para>Since 1998, the Autoconf-based VR Juggler build system has grown
      more and more complex. Originally, the build made use of Autoconf, GNU
      make, and a few small Perl scripts to simplify installations. Now, in
      mid-2002, the build system still makes use of all those tools, but it
      has many, many custom m4 macros (most of which come from Doozer++),
      makefile stubs, Autoconf-like scripts written in Perl, and custom CVS
      utilities. It may yet evolve to include Java- and Python-based
      tools.</para>

      <para>With all this (growing) complexity, the VR Juggler 2.0 build
      system is a colossal effort in software choreography wherein all the
      pieces have to come together in such a way as to exude a
      Broadway-caliber performance. In this book, I strive to lay out the
      steps like one of Arthur Miller's finest teachers.</para>

            </indexterm> software package which forms the basis for the entire
         build. We move on to the specific goals of the VR Juggler build
         system. The scope of the VR Juggler build, while broad, is narrower
         than that of Doozer++, and hence, it will be useful to understand
         first why Doozer++ exists and what purpose it serves.</para>

      <chapter id="philosophy.chapter">
         <title>The Philosophy</title>

         <para>Nearly everything has a philosophy, and the VR Juggler build
         system is no different. The build system philosophy has evolved from
         the following observation: programmers think more about writing their
         code than about compiling it. Compiling takes time that could be
         spent writing code, so compiling must be fast. Command-line arguments
         have little to do with code, and thus they are easily forgotten.
         Paths to external dependencies are esoteric file system thingies that
         are never referenced in code. Because of these points, the basic
         philosophy of the VR Juggler build system and of Doozer++<indexterm>
               <primary>Doozer++</primary>
            </indexterm> in general is simple: automate everything.</para>

         <para>Automation in a build system means doing as much as possible to
         avoid requiring programmers to type anything beyond the following
         familiar command:</para>

         <screen>configure ; make ; make install</screen>

         <para>Whether this is always possible is highly debatable, but either
         way, it should always be the goal. If the above cannot be achieved,
         some mechanism must exist so that programmers feel as though that is
         all they ever have to type.</para>

         <para>There is much more to the philosophy of the VR Juggler build
         system than just automation, but someone looking at the code would
         see that steps to automate configuration and compilation make up a
         sizable percentage of the total line count. Beyond simplifying the
         process of building, we also have the goal of simplifying extensions
         to the build system.</para>

         <para>Unfortunately, repeated experience has shown that no amount of
         simplification is enough to satisfy even the most patient of users.
         This hearkens back to the original point stating that programmers
         focus more on writing their code than on compiling it. A build system
         is always going to be foreign to the majority of the people on any
         given team, and taking the time to learn and understand a build
         system takes up valuable coding time. Despite these bleak statements,
         it is possible to put together a build system that requires little
         effort to extend when a new file must be compiled or a new source
         directory is added. Those who hope for more than this are likely to
         be let down.</para>

         <para>More details on the goals of Doozer++ and the VR Juggler build
         system are provided in the next chapter. All of these goals are
         founded by the philosophy discussed above.</para>

         <para>When the first <glossterm
         linkend="gloss.autoconf">Autoconf</glossterm>-based VR Juggler build
         system was started in mid-1998, we had to make a decision: should we
         use <glossterm linkend="gloss.automake">Automake</glossterm> in
         addition to Autoconf? At the time, we felt that there were several
         problems with Automake<indexterm>
               <primary>Automake</primary>

               <secondary>problems with</secondary>
            </indexterm>, including the following:</para>

         <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>The generated makefiles were too complex to debug</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>Use of compilers other than GCC was too difficult</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>Restrictions on the structure and contents of the source
               tree were undesirable</para>
            </listitem>
         </orderedlist>

         <para>In four years, we have only been proven wrong on point #3. In
         our experience, Automake still generates extremely complex makefiles
         (though it does it very nicely from extremely simple input), and use
         of compilers such as the MIPSpro Compilers or Microsoft Visual C++ is
         still very hard.</para>

         <para>Based on our needs for VR Juggler (and many other projects that
         have been developed at Iowa State University's Virtual Reality
         Applications Center), we identified the following as key goals for
         Doozer++:</para>

         <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
               <para>Simplify the use of Autoconf</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>Allow the use of any operating system</para>

               <para>Allow the use of any compiler</para>
            </listitem>

               <para>Allow code to be written in any language</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
               <para>Use the best tool for a given task</para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

         <para>Each of these goals will be addressed in the following
         sections.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Ease of Use</title>

            <para>Time and time again, we have seen a resistance to the use of
            Autoconf because of its (seemingly) arcane language constructs.
            While macro languages are difficult to use and
            <command>sh</command>(1) syntax is not immediately intuitive,
            neither tool can be considered arcane. Indeed,
            <command>sh</command>(1) is a much more powerful language than
            most other shell scripting languages, but because of its unique
            syntax, people tend to shy away from its use.</para>

            <para>Further complicating the issue is the complexity of Autoconf
            in general. It contains many, many macros, and it defines rules
            for the order of executing those macros. In order to use Autoconf
            effectively, build system developers must read a fair amount of
            documentation (all of which is readily available). In our
            experience, however, many people feel that development build
            system software should be immediately obvious<footnote>
                  <para>Of course, little, if anything, is <quote>immediately
                  obvious</quote> in reality. Users tend to want something
                  that is similar to existing tools or something that allows
                  them to make use of existing knowledge.</para>
               </footnote> and should not require much effort to learn.</para>

            <para>As a result of these issues, we have attempted to make
            Doozer++ easier to use than <quote>raw</quote> Autoconf-based
            <glossterm
            linkend="gloss.configure-script"><email></email>configure
            scripts</glossterm>. Doozer++ macros hide some common details that
            often trip up configure script authors. Many utility macros are
            provided to reduce code duplication between
            <filename>configure.in</filename> files. For example, code for
            verifying that an existing installation of a software package
            meets a version requirement is provided. The code for performing
            the check is modularized to separate the common tasks involved
            with this. Namely, Doozer++ provides macros comparing two version
            numbers, acting on the results of the comparison, and caching the
            results to speed up future tasks. Each macro is used as the basis
            for the next so that users have the freedom to choose how they
            want their code to behave. We feel that this offers a level of
            flexibility not available with Autoconf 2.13.</para>
         </section>

         <section>
            <title>Platform Independence</title>

            <para>Because VR Juggler has always been a cross-platform tool, we
            have had the need for a cross-platform way to build it. The VR
            Juggler 1.0 build system achieved this to a limited degree, and
            Doozer++ goes a step further toward true platform independence. At
            this time, Doozer++ makes use of software utilities found on all
            modern operating systems. The list of utilities includes
            <command>m4</command>(1), <command>sh</command>(1), Perl,
            Autoconf, and GNU make. We have avoided the use of
            platform-specific tools because it is all too easy for the
            platform-specific parts of a build system to get out of sync with
            each other. Furthermore, we have tried to avoid the use of
            platform-specific code whenever possible. This is a more difficult
            goal to achieve, but later sections will address the extent to
            which platform-specific code can be reduced.</para>
         </section>

         <section>
            <title>Compiler Freedom</title>

            <para>As a cross-platform C++ library, VR Juggler must be
            compatible with the prevailing C++ compiler on a given platform.
            In the case of IRIX, that is SGI's MIPSpro Compilers. Similarly,
            the use of Microsoft Visual C++ is crucial on Win32 platforms.
            Open source operating systems such as FreeBSD and Linux use GCC,
            so we have not ignored that compiler whatsoever. Due to our
            limited needs, however, we have focused on compilers for the C,
            C++, Java, and IDL languages<indexterm>
                  <primary>languages</primary>

                  <secondary>supported</secondary>
               </indexterm>. Nothing prevents Doozer++ from being extended to
            allow compiling of code written in FORTRAN, Ada, Pascal,
            etc<indexterm>
                  <primary>languages</primary>

                  <secondary>unsupported (currently)</secondary>
               </indexterm>.</para>

            <para>In Doozer++, an m4 macro sets up the basic platform-specific
            pieces. User-level code (in an Autoconf
            <filename>configure.in</filename> file) then uses that information
            to execute other macros that pick the appropriate compiler. This
            builds upon the foundation provided by Autoconf for detecting
            installed programs, but it goes further by allowing users to
            associate one or more compilers with a given platform. The end
            result is a <quote>fallback</quote> system wherein users specify
            the preferred compiler and zero or more alternatives if the
            preferred compiler is not available. To achieve this flexibility,
            the Doozer++ m4 macros must have no compiler-specific bits.</para>
         </section>

         <section>
            <title>Language Freedom</title>

            <para>Language freedom is slightly more complicated than compiler
            freedom. As will be discussed more fully in the following section,
            Doozer++ separates its work into two pieces: configuration and
            compilation. During configuration, the tools for compilation are
            chosen; during compilation, the chosen tools are put to
            use.</para>

            <para>The primary project building tool is GNU make. We chose GNU
            make initially because of its portability and because it offered
            useful features over most basic <command>make</command>(1)
            implementations. Other implementations, such as BSD make, offer
            even more features, but they are not as portable as GNU
            make.</para>

            <para>Because Doozer++ uses GNU make, users must write makefiles.
            Doozer++ provides a number of modular makefile
            <quote>stubs</quote> that collect common functionality. In
            particular, these stubs provide support for compiling code written
            in Java, C, C++, and IDL. Adding support for other languages can
            be done within Doozer++ or within user-level makefiles.</para>
         </section>

         <section>
            <title>Separation of Tools and Tasks</title>

            <para>The design of Doozer++ involves a distinct separation
            between the tools used and the tasks performed. As a result of
            this separation, there exists the possibility to extend Doozer++
            to use tools other than Autoconf and GNU make. Moreover, different
            combinations are allowed. For example, we have found that
            <command>make</command>(1) does not deal well with compiling Java
            code in general. A more appropriate tool for this task has come
            out of <ulink url="http://jakarta.apache.org/">the Apache Jakarta
            Project</ulink> called <ulink
            url="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Ant</ulink><indexterm>
                  <primary>Ant</primary>
               </indexterm>. Within Doozer++, we could make use of Ant instead
            of or in addition to GNU make to compile Java software. Nothing
            restricts users to Autoconf and/or GNU make.</para>

            <para>The basic idea behind the separation is the following:
            detect and configure the static information needed to execute
            tools that compile a (potentially complex) software system. This
            leads to a two-step process: configuration and compilation. These
            steps are described in the following subsections.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Configuration</title>

               <para>During the configuration stage, we determine what tools
               are available that meet a given set of needs. Typically, this
               means finding suitable compilers and determining what options
               the compilers support. Of course, most projects have more
               complicated needs than this. For example, VR Juggler can be
               compiled with several different versions of GCC (2.95.3 through
               3.1 as of this writing). When moving between platforms, the GCC
               C++ compiler will almost always be called
               <command>g++</command>, but it may not always be the same
               version<footnote>
                     <para>On a platform with multiple GCC installations, the
                     executable names typically vary based on the version. For
                     example, a FreeBSD 4.x installation with multiple GCC
                     builds may have the executables <command>g++</command>,
                     <command>g++30</command>, <command>g++31</command>, and
                     <command>g++32</command> for versions 2.95.4, 3.0, 3.1,
                     and 3.2 respectively. On RedHat Linux 7.2,
                     <command>g++</command> is GCC 2.96 while
                     <command>g++3</command> is GCC 3.0.4.</para>
                  </footnote>. For that reason, it may be necessary to perform
               several version-specific detection steps, including, but not
               limited to, the following:</para>

               or programs. Often times, simply finding an installation is not
               sufficient. The version of the installation must also be
               checked to ensure compatibility with the user's project.</para>

               <para>This all boils down to one thing: automation. The job of
               the configuration step is to automate as much as possible. In
               so doing, the code used to write the compilation can be
               simplified. In effect, the compilation step becomes a very
               generic process that is configured based on many platform-,
               compiler-, and site-specific details that cannot be detected
               easily by a tool designed for compiling.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Compilation</title>

               <para>As we just described in the preceding section, the
               compilation step should be a very generic process. Compiling
               software tends to be a very serialized or step-by-step process.
               Subsequent steps depending on proper completion of preceding
               steps. Nothing in particular about compiling software (or code
               generation in general) has to be tied to a specific set of
               tools. The process should depend more on the source code and
               what steps are necessary to generate the desired
               outcome.</para>

               <para>While it is possible to construct build system software
               that does everything in the compilation step (a la
               Doozer<indexterm>
                     <primary>Doozer</primary>
                  </indexterm> proper), such systems tend to be very
               inflexible. Everything that could provided more generically
               through the configuration phase must be defined statically in
               makefiles (or whatever specification file is being used to
               direct the build process) and in the code. For example,
               consider the following C++ code:</para>

               <programlisting>#if defined(HAVE_HASH_MAP)
#include &lt;hash_map&gt;
#elif defined(HAVE_EXT_HASH_MAP)
#include &lt;ext/hash_map&gt;
#elif defined(HAVE_HASH_MAP_H)
#include &lt;hash_map.h&gt;
#else
#error "std::hash_map is not available with this compiler"
#endif</programlisting>

               <para>The code above is not tied to any specific compiler or
               any specific compiler version. Now, consider the following code
               that achieves the same result:</para>

               <programlisting>#if defined(__GNUC__)
#  if __GNUC__ &lt; 3 &amp;&amp; __GNUC__ &gt;= 2 &amp;&amp; __GNUC_MINOR__ &gt;= 95
#     include &lt;hash_map&gt;
#  elif __GNUC__ &gt;= 3
#     include &lt;ext/hash_map&gt;
#  else
#     include &lt;hash_map.h&gt;
#  endif
#elif defined(__MSVC_VER__)
#  if __MSVC_VER__ &gt;= 7
#     include &lt;hash_map&gt;
#  else
#     error "std::hash_map is not available with this compiler"
#  endif
#elif defined(__sgi__)
#  include &lt;hash_map&gt;
#else
#  error "std::hash_map is not available with this compiler"
#endif</programlisting>

               <para>The former is much shorter and hides all the platform-
               and compiler-specific details in the definition of the various
               <symbol>HAVE_*</symbol> symbols. The latter code is clearly
               much more complicated and only supports three compilers: GCC,
               Visual C++, and MIPSpro. (The latter example may also have
               inaccuracies. Think of it more as pseudo-code than something
               taken from real C++ code.) Certainly, the latter could be
               simplified by adding command-line options defined in platform-
               and compiler-specific <glossterm
               linkend="gloss.makefile-stub">makefile stubs</glossterm>
               (<option>-DHAVE_HASH_MAP</option> and so on), but such options
               would have to be provided for all possible cases. That method
               has obvious scalability problems, however.</para>

               <para>Many other projects provide a variety of platform- and
               tool-specific makefile stubs that set up a build environment at
               the time of compilation. This inevitably leads to an ever
               growing number of stubs as the software becomes more portable
               or as external tools (especially compilers) evolve. For
               example, omniORB 3.0 (an excellent, freely available ORB
               implementation) has forty makefile stubs, four of which are for
               use on varying configurations Linux/i386. The upcoming omniORB
               4.0, on the other hand, uses Autoconf to separate the
               platform-specific pieces from the generic, platform-independent
               compilation work.</para>

            <para>There are many long-term goals for Doozer++ that are beyond

            </indexterm>, and thus the goals of Doozer++ extend into the VR
         Juggler build system. The VR Juggler build system has a much narrower
         scope than Doozer++, so it has some unique goals, and they are as
         follows:</para>

            <listitem>
               <para>Centralize the complexity of the build code</para>

               <para>Port quickly to new platforms</para>
            </listitem>
         </itemizedlist>

         <para>In the following sections, we discuss each of the above goals
         in more detail.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Centralize Complexity</title>

            <para>Due to the size of the VR Juggler 2.0 source base (nearly
            500,000 lines of C++ and Java by one estimate), it is important
            that the complexity of compiling be centralized rather than spread
            out over the entire source tree. Centralizing the complexity
            allows most of the work to be done once, the results of which can
            then be reused by the rest of the build code. This is the key
            tenet for the other goals.</para>

            <para>Centralization of complexity allows the VR Juggler build to
            follow the goal of Doozer++<indexterm>
                  <primary>Doozer++</primary>
               </indexterm> wherein tools and tasks are separated based on
            what they do. The result is that each of the module's has an
            Autoconf- and Doozer++-based configure script that bears the brunt
            of the work needed to hide complexity. Then, each module has one
            or more <glossterm
            linkend="gloss.glue-makefile"><quote>glue</quote>
            makefiles</glossterm> that pull everything together. These glue
            makefiles typically direct a given module's build process so that
            steps occur in the correct order. Because they oversee the whole
            compilation process, they are often large files with many targets,
            each of which is responsible for a specific task. With a configure
            script and a glue makefile, all that remains is a listing of
            source files that must be compiled. The makefiles that list source
            files are often very, very short and easy for anyone to
            extend.</para>

            <para>With this foundation, the complexity is separated
            thusly:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
               <listitem>
                  <para>Platform-specific work happens in a configure script
                  where a flexible programming language is readily
                  available</para>
               </listitem>

               <listitem>
                  <para>Flow of execution during compilation is directed by a
                  single, often long, glue makefile</para>
               </listitem>

               <listitem>
                  <para>Source listings (for any language) are placed in short
                  makefiles that are called by the glue makefile</para>
               </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para>Other steps have been taken to offload complexity or
            repeated tasks into centralized components. For example, the
            directory <filename>juggler/macros</filename> contains Autoconf/m4
            macros that can be used in configure scripts. Most of the macros
            are used to detect and provide information about the various
            modules that comprise VR Juggler. There are a few helper macros
            that build on top of Doozer++ and common idioms we have used to
            simplify configure scripts further.</para>
         </section>

         <section>
            <title>Minimize Special Steps</title>

            <para>As has been discussed at great length previously, it is
            important that users of the build system be freed from remembering
            many command-line arguments or special steps that must be taken to
            build a given piece of software. With several modules to configure
            and build, there is a lot to know about compiling VR Juggler. Most
            modules have external dependencies, the paths to which must be
            specified using command-line arguments. Furthermore, some modules
            may be compiled differently based on configuration-time settings.
            The so-called <quote>global build</quote> manages all of this, and
            so it has the responsibility of reducing the amount of information
            users must remember.</para>

            <para>To that end, the global build offers some features for
            remembering command-line arguments so that users do not have to.
            Many of the configure scripts for the individual modules are
            written such that the default values for arguments are reasonable
            enough that users rarely have to pass them. The combination of
            these two features usually allows the typical developer to run the
            global configure script with no arguments. While this is not
            always the case (for example, on Win32, the path to NSPR must be
            specified unless the user has done something special in his or her
            environment), it happens often enough to keep people reasonably
            happy.</para>
         </section>

         <section>
            <title>Port Quickly to New Platforms</title>

            <para>VR Juggler as a whole is a cross-platform software system.
            Porting to new operating systems is a non-trivial task, and
            spending time porting the build system to new platforms is time
            that could be spent more effectively. Speaking less abstractly,
            before the source code can be ported to a new platform, the build
            system has to be capable of compiling the source code on the new
            platform. For that reason, it is important that the entire build
            system can be put to use right away so that the attention can be
            devoted to the more difficult task of porting C++ code.</para>

            <para>The VR Juggler build system is limited in its portability by
            the portability of Doozer++<indexterm>
                  <primary>Doozer++</primary>
               </indexterm>. To its credit, Doozer++ is more portable than VR
            Juggler at this time, so the VR Juggler team still has some room
            to move. Even so, the VR Juggler build has its own quirks, and
            thus, people writing the code to build VR Juggler must always have
            portability in mind. For example, <quote>BASH-isms</quote> must
            never appear in VR Juggler configure scripts or makefiles. Most
            Linux distributions may use BASH<indexterm>
                  <primary>BASH</primary>

                  <secondary>in makefiles</secondary>
               </indexterm> for <filename>/bin/sh</filename>, but that
            certainly does not meant hat all operating systems vendors follow
            that unfortunate trend.</para>

            <para>In keeping with the Doozer++ goal of separating tools and
            tasks, the VR Juggler build system offers good portability by
            putting all of the platform- and software-specific pieces in
            Autoconf configure scripts. In so doing, the makefiles rarely, if
            ever, have to be modified when a new platform is added to the
            list. Furthermore, makefiles for GNU make lack sufficient
            programmatic constructs to provide developers with the ability to
            write tests that provide more than limited portability. While the
            Doozer software is relatively portable through its use of GNU make
            and platform-specific makefiles, it is missing the expressiveness
            of something based on Autoconf (or a similar tool). As discussed
            in the previous chapter, the use of <command>make</command>(1)
            alone for portability requires much effort to make hard-coded,
            platform- and site-specific makefiles.</para>

         <para>In this chapter, we present the design of the so-called
         <quote>global</quote> build. We cover the high-level aspects of the
         build system that ties together all the other build systems. In a
         sense, this is the one build system to rule them all.</para>

         <section id="global.build.rules.section">
            <title>Follow the Rules</title>

            <para>In order for the global build to work, the modules it wraps
            must follow certain rules. If a module does not comply with all
            the rules, there is no guarantee that it will be able to compile
            under all circumstances. In other words, <quote>rogue</quote>
            modules that only implement a few pieces of the puzzle quickly
            become the weak link in the chain, and module build system authors
            who want to live outside the rule set complicate matters for
            everyone else.</para>

            <para>Because the VR Juggler build system is a complicated dance,
            there are many rules that must be followed. For example, certain
            targets must be defined so that recursive
            <command>make</command>(1) calls can proceed through the entire
            source tree. These targets include '<literal>release</literal>',
            '<literal>install-debug</literal>', '<literal>links</literal>',
            and '<literal>buildworld</literal>'. Other rules include
            restrictions on the names of files or directories, use of
            platform-specific conventions, the presence of a working
            <filename>-config</filename> script (see <xref
            linkend="config.scripts.section" />), and provisions for the
            detection of a usable installation. The full list of rules are
            provided in the following subsections.</para>

                           of the same version. (This has only occurred for one
                           VR Juggler beta release, but it seems like a good
                           idea to have the build time included with a

                  <para>There are three targets used to clean up the build

                  '<literal>cleandepend</literal>' remove disjoint sets of

            <section>
               <title>File and Directory Names</title>

               <para>There are certain naming conventions for files and
               directories that must be followed in order to ensure
               consistency among all the modules in the Juggler Project. Not
               all of these relate directly to the build system, but the names
               may be influenced by the way the build system works.</para>

               <section>
                  <title>Autoconf-Generated Header File</title>

                  <para>All the modules (save one) make use of an
                  Autoconf-generated header file that sets up
                  <symbol>#define</symbol>s based on tests performed by the
                  module's configure script. To avoid overlap or confusion,
                  these files are named based on the module's C++ namespace.
                  Furthermore, the header files must be generated within the
                  module's unique header directory. For example, in Gadgeteer,
                  the C++ namespace is <literal>gadget</literal>. Hence, the
                  header file is <filename>gadgetDefines.h</filename>, and it
                  is generated to the <filename>gadget</filename>
                  directory.</para>

                  <para>The reason for the redundancy is to prevent user
                  errors by avoiding ambiguities. Consider the following bit
                  of code:</para>

                  <programlisting>#include &lt;defines.h&gt;
#include &lt;vpr/Sync/Mutex.h&gt;
#include &lt;vrj/Kernel/Kernel.h&gt;</programlisting>

                  <para>Now, for the sake of this example, assume that a user
                  had both -I$VJ_BASE_DIR/include/vpr and
                  -I$VJ_BASE_DIR/include/vrj on his or her command line. If
                  both VPR and VR Juggler had a <filename>defines.h</filename>
                  file, there would be no way to distinguish which is which.
                  While this is a textbook case of operator error, the naming
                  convention we use avoids this case entirely.</para>

                  <para>The problem arises because the generated header files
                  do not include any other headers in the project. As a
                  result, the generated headers are not tied as tightly to the
                  directory structure as are the static headers. Hence, the
                  above case is not so far-fetched. It could happen very
                  easily with an inexperienced user.</para>
               </section>

               <section>
                  <title>Module Configuration Header</title>

                  <para>Each module has a single header that includes the
                  header file generated by running configure. The idea here is
                  to have a single point where common actions are taken based
                  on what comes in through the generated header. For example,
                  based on platform settings, symbol export macros are defined
                  in the module configuration header. This single header is
                  then included by all the other files in the project.</para>

                  <para>The naming convention for the module configuration
                  header is the same as that of the generated header except
                  that the word <quote>Config</quote> is used instead of
                  <quote>Defines</quote>. The reasoning for this convention is
                  similar to that of the generated header, but in this case,
                  at least one other file from the project is being included.
                  Namely, the generated header file is always included on the
                  first (non-comment) line of this header file. We decided
                  long ago that the name <filename>Config.h</filename> was too
                  common and needed an extra bit of uniqueness. Again, this is
                  done to prevent user errors.</para>
               </section>

               <section>
                  <title>Data Directory</title>

                  <para>In VR Juggler 2.0, the installation of multiple
                  modules must be managed so that one module's (optional)
                  extra data does not conflict with that of another module.
                  All data must be installed into the directory
                  <filename>$(prefix)/share</filename> (to use some
                  <command>make</command>(1) notation). To prevent conflicts
                  with other modules (and with other software that may already
                  exist on the target machine), each module must name a
                  project data directory (the variable
                  <varname>$(projdatadir)</varname> is used to store this in
                  the makefiles). In most cases, the unique directory should
                  be the name of the project in lowercase letters with no
                  spaces. For example, the directory for JCCL would be
                  <filename>$(prefix)/share/jccl</filename>, and the directory
                  for VR Juggler would be
                  <filename>$(prefix)/share/vrjuggler</filename>.</para>

               open, but there are several basic requirements. They are as

                     <para>Headers go in <filename>$prefix/include</filename>.
                     Ideally, a module will use a subdirectory of that for its
                     own header files.</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>Libraries go in subdirectories of
                     <filename>$prefix/lib</filename> (or a variant thereof
                     depending on platform-specific conventions). More
                     specifically, optimized libraries go in
                     <filename>$prefix/lib/opt</filename>, debugging libraries
                     go in <filename>$prefix/lib/debug</filename>, and
                     profiled libraries go in
                     <filename>$prefix/lib/profiled</filename>. There is
                     further subdivision within those directories based on the
                     binary format (ELF, a.out, etc.) and the instruction set
                     architecture (i386, i686, mips4, sparc, etc.). To make
                     things more convenient for users, symlinks to (or copies
                     of depending on the host platform) libraries should be
                     made in <filename>$prefix/lib</filename>. For full
                     releases, we make symlinks to the optimized libraries. In
                     the developer installation, we make symlinks to the
                     debugging libraries. Typically, profiled libraries will
                     be named differently than their non-profiled
                     counterparts, so symlinks to those can be made along side
                     the non-profiled versions.</para>

            <para>The script <filename>configure.pl</filename> is a Perl
            script written to act as part of a build wrapper around an
            arbitrary collection of software modules. The modules are linked
            through some sort of (conceptual) <glossterm

            proceeds to configure the individual modules in an order that

            with the correct settings. The processes of managing the

               <para>Before explaining how <filename>configure.pl</filename>
               manages its dependencies, it will be helpful to understand the
               role played by the configuration file from which the
               dependencies are read. In the VR Juggler build system, the file
               is called <filename>juggler.cfg</filename>, and it is located
               in the top-level source directory. At a very high level, the
               configuration file defines one or more modules that must be
               configured and compiled. The modules may be independent of each
               other, or they may form a dependency graph. In the latter case,
               one module states that it depends on one or more other modules.
               The following code block shows an example of this:</para>

                     <para>The fact that any variable can be set but that some
                     are treated as special cases is a deficiency in the
                     design of <filename>configure.pl</filename>. The current
                     use was put together out of necessity to provide the
                     script with extra information needed for proper execution
                     of each module's Autoconf-generated configure
                     script.</para>
                  </footnote>. Those variables ending in
               <symbol>_CONFIG</symbol> set the corresponding environment
               variable to include the full path to the named file (despite
               the fact that the full path is not given in the assignment).
               The path is constructed using the associated directory
               dependency. This directory is also added to the script's
               execution path. This extra little bit is needed so that a given
               <filename>-config</filename> script can be executed by another
               <filename>-config</filename> script if necessary. (The details
               about why all of this is necessary are discussed in <xref
               linkend="config.scripts.section" />.)</para>

               <para>Those variables ending in <symbol>_BASE_DIR</symbol>
               define the installation directory for the given module. In the
               VR Juggler build system, this is necessary for dependent
               modules to find the headers and libraries they need to compile.
               (Again, more information about this is given in <xref
               linkend="config.scripts.section" />.) Once again, the value
               being assigned has special significance. If the value is the
               token <token>instlinks</token>, it is taken to mean that the
               <emphasis>full path</emphasis> to the installed module is in a
               directory relative to the current directory called
               <filename>instlinks</filename><indexterm>
                     <primary>instlinks</primary>
                  </indexterm>. Any other value is used verbatim as the value
               of the environment variable.</para>

               of this data structure. There is one such instance for each
               module defined. Each instance contains an array of
               <classname>ModuleDependecy</classname> objects. Steps are taken
               to ensure that there is no duplication of dependencies within a

            by users of VR Juggler and associated modules is put to use by the
            code that compiles everything. It makes use of a strict set of
            behaviors wherein various environment settings and command-line
            options form a hierarchy of preferences and fallbacks. If anything
            goes wrong with a user's configuration process, it is almost
            always related to a <filename>.m4</filename> file or a
            <filename>-config</filename> script giving unexpected results

                  <para>In the Juggler Project, we use the
                  <filename>-config</filename> scripts in an interesting
                  manner. A given script, say
                  <filename>gadgeteer-config</filename><indexterm>
                        <primary>gadgeteer-config</primary>
                     </indexterm>, will call all the
                  <filename>-config</filename> scripts of the modules on which
                  it depends. The collected output is compressed and returned
                  to the user. In this way, we avoid trying to manage all the
                  dependency information in every module. Instead, we rely on
                  each module to report its information correctly. Then, the
                  highest level module only has to collect it and print it
                  out.</para>

                  <para>The key to this functionality is that all the
                  <filename>-config</filename> scripts can be found in the
                  user's path. Furthermore, because our
                  <filename>-config</filename> scripts are written in Perl, we
                  have easy access to the path used to invoke each script.
                  (This is actually a side effect of the scripts being in the
                  user's path, and the path information would be available
                  regardless of the scripting language. Perl just makes it
                  easy to extract and operate on the given
                  information.)</para>

                  <para>The dependencies only come into play for certain
                  information requests. Those requests are the
                  following:</para>

                     </listitem>
                  </itemizedlist>

                  <para>Each of the above iteratively calls the
                  <filename>-config</filename> script(s) from the dependency
                  module(s) using at least a subset of the arguments specified
                  by the user on the command line. One additional argument is
                  given that reduces the amount of output:
                  <option>--min</option>. This causes each script to print out
                  only the minimal information needed for compiling. The
                  motivation for doing this is to keep the compile lines short
                  whenever possible.</para>

                  </indexterm>

                  <para>Finally, we explain the last detail relating to all
                  <filename>-config</filename> scripts used in the Juggler
                  Project: script generation. As part of the global build, all
                  these scripts must be generated at configuration time. This
                  is necessary for each subsequent module to be configured
                  correctly. That means that each module's configure script is
                  making use of <quote>external</quote>
                  <filename>-config</filename> scripts to get command-line
                  arguments and version information. This allows the use of
                  pre-existing installations of dependencies. For example,
                  Gadgeteer depends on JCCL and VPR. Normally, it would
                  satisfy those dependencies using source from the same tree,
                  but a user may already have JCCL and VPR built and
                  installed. By setting up his or her path correctly,
                  <filename>vpr-config</filename><indexterm>
                        <primary>vpr-config</primary>
                     </indexterm> and
                  <filename>jccl-config</filename><indexterm>
                        <primary>jccl-config</primary>
                     </indexterm> can be found, and Gadgeteer can be built
                  using the existing installations.</para>

                  <para>As of this writing, there are no hard and fast rules
                  regarding script generation other than the fact that they
                  must be generated as part of module configuration. The
                  prevailing convention within a given
                  <filename>configure.in</filename> is to make separate
                  <glossterm
                  linkend="gloss.substitution-variable">substitution
                  variables</glossterm> used only in the
                  <filename>-config.in</filename> template file. That is to
                  say that these variables are separate from those used in
                  template makefiles and other <filename>.in</filename>
                  templates. The separation is done through syntax alone.
                  Those variables that are substituted in the generation of a
                  <filename>-config</filename> script are spelled using
                  lowercase letters exclusively. Other substitution variables
                  are spelled using all uppercase letters.</para>

                  <para>Again, this is not a hard and fast rule. Indeed, some
                  variables are shared between all files (for example,
                  <varname>$USE_GCC</varname> or
                  <varname>$MAJOR_VERSION</varname>). In general, such
                  exceptions are allowed because there is no difference in
                  usage between a <filename>-config</filename> script and a
                  generated makefile. The important distinctions arise with
                  compiler and linker flags. In particular, there are some
                  flags that should only be used in the process of building a
                  given module but should not be exposed to users. An example
                  is the MIPSpro <option>-Woff</option> flag that is used to
                  disable compile-time warnings. Exporting this option would
                  force users to disable the same warnings whether they want
                  to or not. Essentially, it is up to the module build system
                  author to use good judgement when deciding what to export
                  and what to use internally.</para>

                  <para>To summarize, the separation of the substitution
                  variables is done for two reasons:</para>

                  <orderedlist>
                     <listitem>
                        <para>To manage potential differences in semantics
                        between module compilation and module use.</para>
                     </listitem>

                     <listitem>
                        <para>To make it clear to readers of the relevant
                        files which variables are used for which
                        purpose.</para>
                     </listitem>
                  </orderedlist>

                  <para>To date, this mechanism has worked well (at least for
                  those few who know about it). In one case, failure to follow
                  this convention caused compilation of a module to break
                  because a linker variable was serving double duty. This
                  variable was setting internal linker options and forcing the
                  use of those same options for external code.</para>

               <para>With an understanding of what information a
               <filename>-config</filename> file provides, we can move on to
               the m4 macros that make use of those files at configuration
               time. Each module in the Juggler Project has a corresponding m4
               macro suitable for use within an Autoconf
               <filename>configure.in</filename> file. For example, Gadgeteer
               has a macro called <function>GADGETEER_PATH</function>. This
               macro is used in VR Juggler's <filename>configure.in</filename>
               to find a usable Gadgeteer installation.</para>

               <para>The basic concept behind all these macros is the same:
               provide a way for a configure script to detect a usable
               installation. The way this is done is fairly straightforward.
               The basic step-by-step process is as follows:</para>

                     <quote>return</quote><footnote>
                           <para>Actually, these macros do not return because
                           the code is inlined. Moreover, the user-specified
                           failure steps may include halting the configure
                           script and exiting with failure status.</para>
                        </footnote>.</para>

                     <para>Using the <filename>-config</filename> script, get

                  <listitem>
                     <para>If the version is sufficient, execute the

                     <filename>-config</filename> script. If the version
                     comparison fails, execute the user-specified failure

                  </listitem>
               </orderedlist>

               <para>We now proceed into the details of a typical
               <filename>.m4</filename> file. First, we will cover the
               mechanism used to deal with paths to installations. Then, we
               explain what variables must be set by a module's m4
               macro.</para>

               <section>
                  <title>Path Setting Preferences</title>

                  <para>The most complex part about understanding the Juggler
                  Project <filename>.m4</filename> files is the management of
                  path setting preferences. The path in question is the path
                  to the installed module. The installation may be on the
                  local file system, or it may exist as a developer
                  pseudo-installation (refer to <xref
                  linkend="instlinks.section" /> for more information on that
                  topic). The specification of that path by the user is where
                  we now direct our interest. The following list gives the
                  path setting preferences in order of decreasing preference
                  (i.e., the first has highest precedence, and the last has
                  lowest precedence):</para>

                        <filename>-config</filename> script. The name of the
                        environment depends on the specific
                        <filename>.m4</filename> file. For example,
                        <filename>vpr.m4</filename> checks for
                        <varname>$VPR_CONFIG</varname>. In general, the
                        environment variable name should match the name of the
                        <filename>-config</filename> script except in
                        capitalization and the use of an underscore (_)

                        the <filename>.m4</filename> file is written to

                  <para>Upon successful completion of step 3 (see above),
                  there are several shell variables defined for the calling
                  code to use. Typically, these variables are concatenated
                  with other variables to form the full set of options passed
                  to the compiler and the linker. In order to maintain
                  consistency across all the <filename>.m4</filename> files,
                  it is important to know what variables must be defined and

                  categories: minimal and maximal. The basic idea with minimal
                  versus maximal flags is to allow the user some flexibility
                  in composing the full command-line options. The minimal
                  variables provide only the minimum amount of information
                  needed for compiling. No dependency information is included.
                  For example, such settings usually include one or two header
                  path extensions (<option>-I</option> options) and mandatory
                  compiler flags such as <option>-LANG:std</option>. The
                  maximal variables, on the other hand, include all the
                  information needed for compiling including dependency data.
                  More concretely, the minimal C++ compiler flags for
                  Gadgeteer would give the header path for the Gadgeteer
                  headers and any mandatory compiler flags. The maximal C++
                  compiler flags would include the minimal information as well
                  as flags relating to JCCL, Tweek, and VPR (in that order).
                  The same would be true for linker flags. To summarize, the
                  minimal variables must be mixed with other minimal variables
                  if the module has dependencies; the maximal variables can
                  stand on their own.</para>

                  <para>Within the minimal and maximal categories, there are
                  two more categories: compiler flags and linker flags. Based
                  on the discussion above, this distinction should be fairly
                  obvious. This distinction is made to deal with platforms
                  where the compiler is not used to perform the link stage.
                  Since some compilers can call the linker as necessary,
                  <emphasis>linking</emphasis> flags<footnote>
                        <para>Note the distinction between
                        <emphasis>linker</emphasis> flags (flags for the
                        linker program) and <emphasis>linking</emphasis> flags
                        (flags used to link object files).</para>
                     </footnote> suitable for use with the compiler are
                  provided. The distinction is made by the variable name.
                  Linking flags that can be passed to the compiler have
                  <varname>_CC_</varname> in their name; linking flags for the
                  linker have <varname>_LD_</varname> in their name.</para>

                  <para>Continuing with the subdivision, the linking flags are
                  divided into two categories: static and dynamic. This is
                  done to allow static linking of one or more libraries
                  instead of dynamic linking. The usual default would be
                  dynamic linking, and the variable names reflect that. Those
                  variables that contain static linking flags have
                  <varname>_STATIC_</varname> in their names.</para>

            <para>At various times in the history of the VR Juggler project,
            the developer <quote>pseudo-installation</quote> has been a topic
            of great controversy. Questions (or arguments, depending on your
            perspective) regarding its usefulness and its differences from a
            release installation come up repeatedly. The reason for its
            existence is quite simple: to simplify the lives of developers.
            The differences between the developer installation are also fairly
            simple. In a nutshell, a developer installation uses debugging
            libraries by default and links applications statically<indexterm>
                  <primary>developer installation</primary>

                  <secondary>differences from release</secondary>
               </indexterm>. A release installation, on the other hand, uses
            optimized libraries by default and links applications dynamically.
            The reasoning behind this is a little more difficult to nail down,
            and for that reason, we will say that it is beyond the scope of
            the document.</para>

            <para>To satisfy the only goal of the developer installation
            (simplification of developers' lives), the developer installation
            must act exactly like a release installation, but it must be
            inside the build tree. The developer installation is created
            automatically as part of the build process, and ideally, its
            construction is faster than that of a full release installation.
            In any case, if all goes well, a developer can treat this
            pseudo-installation as if it were a real installation for the
            purposes of running tests.</para>

            <para>Prior to early August 2002, the developer installation was
            created separately from a release installation. This was done
            through the use of symlinks on UNIX-based platforms and file
            copies on Win32. Since August 2002, the developer installation
            still uses symlinks or file copies in the same manner, but there
            is no longer a separation between creation of the developer
            installation and the release installation. In other words, the
            release installation is used to make the developer installation,
            but it is directed to install into the build tree.</para>

            <para>The decision to use symlinks or file copies is based on the
            host platform and on the use of the '<literal>links</literal>'
            target that every module must define. Using a custom Perl script,
            <command>bsd-install.pl</command><indexterm>
                  <primary>bsd-install.pl</primary>
               </indexterm>, written to be fully compatible with BSD
            <command>install</command>(1), symlinks may be created instead of
            using file copies. (The <command>bsd-install.pl</command> script
            comes with Doozer++<indexterm>
                  <primary>Doozer++</primary>
               </indexterm> 1.5 and beyond.) Within the script, a test is
            performed to determine if the host platform is a Win32 system. If
            so, copies are always used because there are no symlinks on Win32
            file systems. All of these decisions had been made in each
            module's build system, but they have since been offloaded into
            <command>bsd-install.pl</command>. This is in keeping with the
            Doozer++ goal of centralizing complexity.</para>
         </section>

         <section>
            <title>Future Goals</title>

            <para>At one time, there was a long-term goal for this global
            build script, or <quote>project builder</quote>. In conjunction
            with <command>cvs-gather.pl</command>, a semi-arbitrary collection
            of software packages would be downloaded and compiled. The
            commonality between them would be the use of configure scripts
            that would be invoked by the project builder. The dependencies
            would be specified through some configuration file, possibly
            written in XML, that would be constructed on the fly based on the
            <command>cvs-gather.pl</command> dependency file.</para>

            <para>These lofty plans have not materialized, and it is unclear
            whether the need for such a tool still exists. Nonetheless, the
            idea of a highly generalized project builder played a key role in
            the way that <command>configure.pl</command> was written. In
            particular, its highly generic nature was motivated by the
            potential for downloading arbitrary source code and running a
            configure script. The makefile generated by
            <command>configure.pl</command> initially followed this goal, too,
            but it has since had its scope narrowed to deal with the specific
            conventions of the VR Juggler project.</para>

         <title>The Documentation Build</title>

         <para>The documentation for the individual modules is maintained
         separately from the source code build. This is done primarily because
         writing code to DocBook and related software would take too much time
         and gain us very little. For the most part, the Juggler Project
         documentation is intended for posting on the website. As such, the
         build environment is much more controlled than one that is provided
         for (easy?) use by the general public. The documentation build is
         still configurable, but in a different, less automatic method than
         what is used to build the source tree. This chapter explains the
         rules of the documentation build and how to configure it for use
         outside the VRAC lab.</para>

         <section>
            <title>The Rules</title>

            <para>Any module with DocBook-based documentation can be added to
            the documentation build. As with the source code build, there are
            rules that must be followed. With this smaller, less complicated
            build system, there are fewer things to deal with.</para>

               the documentation build. As a reference, refer to the file
               <filename>juggler/Makefile.docs</filename>. This list,

                        to each makefile to determine how much is built. In
                        general, the makefiles are set up to generate HTML,
                        PDF, and PostScript. This output may come from DocBook
                        XML source or from output generated by Doxygen. Other
                        tools may be used, but these two are the favored
                        generators at this time.</para>

                        '<literal>docs</literal>' target. By default, the

                        <filename>$HOME/public_html/jugglerweb</filename> as
                        the base prefix. This truly reflects the intended use
                        of this build system. (To redirect the installed
                        output, simply change the setting for

               <para>Targets such as '<literal>clean</literal>' and
               '<literal>clobber</literal>' are needed as well, but those
               makefiles that include docbook.mk get them for free. If a
               documentation generating makefile is not using docbook.mk, it
               must make its own '<literal>clean</literal>' and
               '<literal>clobber</literal>' targets.</para>

               <title>Installation Hierarchy</title>

               <para>The individual documentation building makefiles are
               expected to behave when installing the generated documentation.
               That is, they should install to a subdirectory of
               <varname>$(webroot)</varname> that reflects the appropriate
               project. In many cases, the installation hierarchy should also
               reflect the version of the software against which the
               documentation was written.</para>

               <para>Each makefile is responsible for creating its own
               installation hierarchy and for installing any related, external
               files. The documentation build offers some automation to help
               with this, but its abilities are limited. At this time, the
               documentation build can be directed to install the image files
               that come with the DocBook style sheets and any local images
               that the documentation needs.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Configuration and Customization</title>

            <para>At this time, most of the documentation in the Juggler
            Project is written using DocBook. Because of that, the settings
            for building documents from DocBook files are centralized in the
            file <filename>juggler/doc/docbook.mk</filename>. This file is
            parameterized to the extreme so that including makefiles can
            override its default settings easily. Usually, makefiles that
            include docbook.mk direct the build to use OpenJade, Saxon, or
            Xalan to process the DocBook input and PassiveTeX, FOP, or XEP to
            create PDF files. Further configuration can be done that chooses
            different versions or installations of the DocBook style sheets,
            Saxon, Xalan, FOP, etc. The following is the makefile used to
            generate HTML and PDF versions of this document:</para>

         <para>In this part, we discuss the topic that seems most fearsome to
         the majority of Juggler team members: build system extension. While
         this does not have to be a complex topic, most people shy away from
         it because they do not want to spend time trying to understand any
         given build system. Whether anyone will even bother to read this far
         into this book is debatable, and this is only the second attempt in
         four years to write this documentation. Perhaps this time, it will be
         worth the effort.</para>

         <title>Extending the Global Configuration Script</title>

         <para>Most extensions to <filename>configure.pl</filename> can be
         localized to the <filename>JugglerConfigure.pm</filename> module
         file. That module contains the configuration file parsing code and
         two data structures (<classname>JugglerModule</classname> and
         <classname>ModuleDependency</classname>) for managing the data that
         is parsed. In <filename>configure.pl</filename>, most of the code
         relates to execution of the configure scripts in the individual
         modules. This includes running the configuration scripts to configure
         a build tree and running them to collect, reformat, and output usage
         information (the output normally printed from passing
         <option>--help</option>). In this chapter, we examine both files
         separately and explain how to extend them.</para>

            </indexterm>

            <para>This file contains three Perl packages:
            <literal>JugglerConfigure</literal>,
            <literal>JugglerModule</literal>, and
            <literal>ModuleDependency</literal>. The first has a single
            procedure, <function>parseConfigFile()</function>, that parses the
            user-specified configuration
            (<filename>juggler.cfg</filename><indexterm>
                  <primary>juggler.cfg</primary>
               </indexterm> in most cases). The latter two define data
            structures (Perl classes) used to manage individual modules
            defined in the configuration file and the dependencies of each
            module. We will discuss each package in turn.</para>

            <section id="JugglerConfigure.pkg.section">
               <title><literal>JugglerConfigure</literal></title>

               </indexterm>

               <para>As stated above, this package contains a single
               subroutine: <function>parseConfigFile()</function>. This parses
               a user-specified configuration file in the format described in
               <xref linkend="build.cfg.file.section" />. If the config file
               is parsed correctly, a hash named <varname>%MODULES</varname>
               is returned to the caller. This hash, indexed by module name,
               provides references to <classname>JugglerModule</classname>
               instances.</para>

               <para>The parsing code is fairly straightforward. There are
               only three keywords in the configuration file format:
               <token>module</token>, <token>depend</token>, and
               <token>Default</token>. The basic concepts used in the format
               are similar to those for the C grammar. In other words, curly
               braces denote blocks, semi-colons denote the end of a
               declaration, and all code is case-sensitive. The following
               provides the grammar for the configuration file:</para>

               <programlisting>DOCUMENT   ::= COMMENT DEFAULT MODULE
DEFAULT    ::= 'Default:' NAME | ε
MODULE     ::= NAME '{' COMMENT DEPENDENCY '}' COMMENT MODULE | ε
NAME       ::= ([A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_]* + λ)[A-Za-z0-9_]
DEPENDENCY ::= DIR ';' DEPENDENCY | MODDEP ';' DEPENDENCY | ε
DIR        ::= &lt;valid-path&gt; | &lt;valid-path&gt; ':' ENVVAR
ENVVAR     ::= NAME '=' &lt;text&gt; | NAME '=' &lt;text&gt; ',' ENVVAR
MODDEP     ::= 'depend' NAME
COMMENT    ::= '#' &lt;text&gt; | '//' &lt;text&gt; | '/*' &lt;text&gt; '*/' | ε</programlisting>

               <para>The structure of this grammar should be reflected in the
               parsing code. Differences between strict regular expressions
               (used above, more or less) and Perl regular expressions may
               muddy the correlation.</para>

               <para>The <literal>JugglerModule</literal> package defines a
               class containing two <quote>data members</quote>:
               <varname>name</varname> and <varname>deps</varname>. These are
               actually keys of the blessed hash returned by the
               <function>new()</function> subroutine. The
               <varname>name</varname> member is just a string that contains
               the unique name of the module. The <varname>deps</varname>
               member is more interesting. Indeed, the main purpose of the
               <literal>JugglerModule</literal> package is to maintain the
               list of dependencies.</para>

               <para>The <varname>deps</varname> member is a reference to an
               array of <classname>ModuleDependency</classname> objects (see
               <xref linkend="ModuleDependency.pkg.section" />). An array is
               used to preserve the ordering read from the configuration file.
               All dependencies given in the configuration file appear in the
               array. This includes those <quote>inherited</quote> from
               another module through the use of the <token>depend</token>
               keyword.</para>

               <para>Duplication of dependencies is avoided by performing a
               check whenever a new dependency is added using
               <methodname>addDependency()</methodname>. The
               <methodname>hasDependency()</methodname> method encapsulates
               the process of making the check. The dependencies of two
               modules can be merged using the
               <methodname>addDependencies()</methodname> method.</para>

               <para>The <literal>ModuleDependency</literal> package defines a

               <varname>path</varname> and <varname>env</varname>. The first
               is a simple string, and the second is a reference to a hash
               where the keys are environment variable names. The values for
               these are extracted from the <literal>DIR</literal> rule in the
               above grammar. More specifically, the terminal
               <token>&lt;valid-path&gt;</token> in <literal>DIR</literal>
               rule corresponds to the path member, and the
               <literal>ENVVAR</literal> rule defines the hash of environment
               variable mappings.</para>

               <para>Access to a given <classname>JugglerModule</classname>
               object's dependencies happens entirely through the API of that

            <para>This script pulls everything together. After calling
            <function>JugglerConfigure::parseConfigFile()</function>, the
            returned hash (see <xref
            linkend="JugglerConfigure.pkg.section" />) is used to perform all
            the relevant operations including, but not limited to, invoking
            each Autoconf-based configure script in the correct order. As a
            whole, the work done by <command>configure.pl</command> is fairly
            straightforward, regardless of the arguments passed on the command
            line. In this section, we will examine the four main aspects of
            this script's functionality:</para>

            </orderedlist>

            <para>We will present each in turn with the goal that
            understanding these pieces of functionality, extensions to
            <command>configure.pl</command> will be easier to perform. Of
            these points, #3 will require the most discussion since that is
            the main reason for <command>configure.pl</command>'s
            existence.</para>

                  <secondary>command-line argument handling</secondary>
               </indexterm>

               <para>The handling of command-line arguments in
               <command>configure.pl</command> is rather unique. To function
               correctly as a wrapper around multiple Autoconf-based build
               systems, this script must be capable of passing the correct
               arguments to the individual configure scripts. In other words,
               when the user executes the following:</para>

               <screen>configure.pl --module=VPR --enable-subsystem=NSPR --with-nspr=$HOME/nspr-4.2</screen>

               <para>the argument <option>--module</option> must be handled by
               <command>configure.pl</command> while the other two are passed
               through to VPR's configure script. Luckily, the Perl module
               <literal>Getopt::Long</literal> provides a mechanism for doing
               just that. The module is configured to allow unrecognized
               arguments to be passed through so that, after the execution of
               <function>GetOptions()</function>, <varname>@ARGV</varname>
               will contain what <function>GetOptions()</function> did not
               handle. When the time comes to execute a module's configure
               script, <varname>@ARGV</varname> is passed to the script as
               normal arguments.</para>

               <para>This usage of <literal>Getopt::Long</literal> is not
               without a drawback or two. Allowing the pass through of
               unrecognized arguments means that
               <function>GetOptions()</function> is not performing robust
               error checking on user input. What if <option>--module</option>
               were spelled as <option>--mdoule</option> accidentally?
               <function>GetOptions()</function> would not recognize it, and
               the execution of <command>configure.pl</command> would not
               proceed the way the user had intended. Because of this, it is
               important for users to be especially careful with the options
               they give when running <command>configure.pl</command>.</para>

               <para>Two types of output can be printed by

               <literal>Pod::Usage</literal> module is used to render the
               internal <glossterm linkend="gloss.pod">POD</glossterm> as
               usage output<footnote>
                     <para>Use of this very handy Perl module has actually
                     been a source of problems. In particular, IRIX 6.5 ships
                     with a version of Perl that does not contain this module.
                     For that reason, Perl 5.005 or newer is required to run
                     <command>configure.pl</command> and some other Perl
                     scripts used by the build system.</para>
                  </footnote>. This output is printed when the user passes
               <option>--help</option> on the command line.</para>

               <para>Usage information for the known configure scripts can be
               printed using the <option>--all-help</option> argument. This is
               provided so that users have a way to get a complete listing of
               all the command-line arguments that may be passed when running
               <command>configure.pl</command>. (The exact details of how this
               works were described in the previous subsection.) Only the
               relevant output is actually printed when this argument is
               passed. The meaning of <quote>relevant</quote> is tied to the
               module the user is configuring. For example, with an unmodified

                     <primary>juggler.cfg</primary>
                  </indexterm>, the default module is <quote>VRJuggler</quote>
               (sic). If the <option>--module</option> option is not specified
               in conjunction with <option>--all-help</option>, then the usage
               information for the VR Juggler configure script and the use
               information for the configure scripts of all of its
               dependencies are printed. If a different module is specified,
               the output will change based on the alternate module and its
               dependencies.</para>

               <para>To print this information, each configure script is run
               by <command>configure.pl</command> with the
               <option>--help</option> command-line option. The output is
               collected and processed so that the arguments are printed to
               the screen in an orderly fashion. Duplicated output is
               discarded. The process of presenting the output to the user is
               very important because there exists the potential for a large
               amount of information.</para>

                  </indexterm>

                  <para>To simplify the execution of
                  <command>configure.pl</command>, users may write a default
                  arguments file or a Perl plug-in that provides default
                  arguments. In either case, the idea is that arguments for
                  Autoconf-generated configure scripts can be collected into
                  reusable platform- and site-specified pieces so that they do
                  not have to be passed every time
                  <command>configure.pl</command> is run. The preferred method
                  for specifying default arguments is the Perl plug-in, but
                  for users who do not know Perl, a simple configuration file
                  can be used instead. Here, we will only describe the process
                  of loading these files, not how to use them.</para>

                  <para>To load the Perl plug-in, the arguments file is
                  treated as loadable Perl code. (Indeed, the requirements of
                  using the Perl plug-in state that it must be valid Perl code
                  with a subroutine that can be called by another package.)
                  Once the plug-in is loaded into memory, its subroutine is
                  executed. The subroutine must return an array of
                  command-line arguments that can be merged with
                  <varname>@ARGV</varname>. It is the responsibility of the
                  plug-in to inform <command>configure.pl</command> of its
                  executable subroutine by assigning a subroutine reference to
                  a global variable in <command>configure.pl</command>'s
                  scope. In <command>configure.pl</command>, this whole
                  process involves roughly four lines of code, thus making it
                  very attractive from the standpoint of maintaining
                  <command>configure.pl</command>.</para>

                  <para>Loading the simple configuration file requires more
                  effort because the file format must be parsed. In
                  <command>configure.pl</command>, the parsing code for this
                  file format is found in
                  <function>loadDefaultArgs()</function>. To summarize the
                  file format, platform-specific blocks are defined, and
                  within a block, each line gives a configure script argument.
                  The platform-specific blocks are named according to
                  platform, though they can be named with user-defined
                  identifiers when used in conjunction with the
                  <option>--os</option> command-line option. Parsing the file
                  simply means reading the right block(s) and adding each line
                  to <varname>@ARGV</varname>.</para>

                  <para>Generating the <command>reconfig</command> helper
                  script is quite simple. The arguments passed on the command
                  line are simply saved to the <filename>reconfig</filename>
                  file. In addition, commands to remove any Autoconf cache
                  files (named <filename>config.cache</filename>) are added.
                  Finally, the <command>reconfig</command> file is made
                  executable.</para>

                  <para>This step is where <command>configure.pl</command>
                  works the hardest. Ultimately, what must happen is that a
                  given module's configure script is executed, and if it exits
                  without failing, the execution environment of
                  <command>configure.pl</command> is extended to reflect new
                  information. This new information comes from the environment
                  variable settings in the original configuration file. The
                  details of how this works are a little bit more complicated,
                  however.</para>

                  <para>The real goal of <command>configure.pl</command> is to
                  run the configure script of the module the user wants to
                  configure and build. Along the way, it may have to run
                  configure scripts for one or more dependencies. Dependency
                  information has already been covered in great detail, and we
                  will not repeat it here. To ensure that the dependencies are
                  configured in the correct order, the array of dependencies
                  within the <classname>JugglerModule</classname> object is
                  requested. Each dependency's configure script is run, and
                  the execution environment is extended accordingly. The last
                  dependency of a module is the actual module the user wants
                  to configure and build. Once its configure script completes
                  successfully, the top-level makefile can at last be
                  generated.</para>

                  <para>The environment variables that are set reflect the
                  delicate balance between <command>configure.pl</command>,
                  <command>configure.pl</command>'s configuration file, the
                  <filename>*-config</filename> scripts, and the
                  <filename>*.m4</filename> files (see <xref
                  linkend="config.scripts.section" />). Based on the rules set
                  forth by the <filename>*-config</filename> scripts and the
                  <filename>*.m4</filename> files, the execution environment
                  must be set up so that each subsequent configure script can
                  get information about any dependencies it has.</para>

                  </indexterm>

                  <para>Generating the top-level makefile is relatively easy
                  (it is mostly search-and-replace operations), but
                  interestingly, this is one of the places where
                  <command>configure.pl</command> falls short of acting like
                  an Autoconf-based configure script. A template makefile
                  (<filename>juggler/Makefile.in</filename>) is always the
                  only file generated by <command>configure.pl</command>
                  (aside from the <command>reconfig</command> script). There
                  is no way to specify other files. Even if there were,
                  <command>configure.pl</command> does not have easy access to
                  the results of all the tests performed by the various
                  configure scripts.</para>

                  <para>As a result of these limitations, there are only a few
                  strings that can be expanded in the generated makefile. At
                  this time, only two variables can be expanded:
                  <literal>@JUGGLER_PROJECTS@</literal> and
                  <literal>@topdir@</literal>. The expansion of the first
                  depends on the configured module and its dependencies; the
                  expansion of the second is simply the directory where
                  <command>configure.pl</command> was run.</para>

               <para>When an Autoconf-generated configure script is run
               successfully, a shell script called
               <command>config.status</command><indexterm>
                     <primary>config.status</primary>
                  </indexterm> is created. This script contains all the state
               information generated as a result of running
               <command>configure</command>. If there is a need to regenerate
               the files created by <command>configure</command>,
               <command>config.status</command> can do the job quickly because
               it reuses the static information from when it was created
               without re-running all the tests. There is no global
               <command>config.status</command> created by
               <command>configure.pl</command>, but an alternate method is
               provided through the <option>--regen</option> argument.</para>

               <para>When <option>--regen</option> is passed on the command
               line, <command>configure.pl</command> iteratively executes the
               individual <command>config.status</command> scripts instead of
               the configure scripts. This allows users to regenerate files
               more quickly than by running all the configure scripts again.
               Deciding which <command>config.status</command> scripts to run
               is a somewhat difficult process, however.</para>

               <para>In a normal situation when only one
               <command>config.status</command> exists, it is easy for a user
               to decide when (and how) to run it. In the context of the VR
               Juggler build system, there are many configure scripts, each
               having its own <command>config.status</command> script.
               Furthermore, some <command>config.status</command> scripts may
               not exist based on which module (in
               <filename>juggler.cfg</filename><indexterm>
                     <primary>juggler.cfg</primary>
                  </indexterm>) was configured. As with all other cases where
               <command>configure.pl</command> must decide what to execute,
               the requested module dictates the execution behavior. Thus, if
               the user did not configure the default module, the
               <option>--module</option> argument must be passed with
               <option>--regen</option> to ensure proper execution of the
               various <command>config.status</command> scripts.</para>

         <title>Extending a Module's Configure Script</title>

         <para>To extend a module's configure script, an understanding of
         Autoconf is required. Without this background, it is very difficult
         to make good changes. Furthermore, trying to write a decent configure
         script from scratch is nearly impossible without first having read
         the basic rules of configure script structure. We will not cover
         those in detail since the Autoconf documentation already addresses
         these topics.</para>

         <para>We will, however, explain the basic structure of (nearly) all
         the configure scripts in the Juggler Project. An understanding of
         this very simple structure makes editing the
         <filename>configure.in</filename> files much easier. We will also
         explain a little bit of <command>sh</command>(1) syntax and the
         coding conventions used in <filename>configure.in</filename>
         files.</para>

         <para>Because there are so many <filename>configure.in</filename>
         files, consistency among all of them is very important. It only takes
         one script that does not follow the rules to complicate maintenance
         of the entire build.</para>

            <para>In this section, we present the basic concepts of

            may be interesting to note that some of the content in this
            section was written in mid-1998 and has been copied verbatim.

               standard <quote>#</quote> comment. Lines beginning with this
               character are copied into the final configure script generated
               by <command>autoconf</command>(1). The other type is the
               <command>m4</command>(1) comment. Lines commented in this way
               begin with <literal>dnl</literal> and are not copied into the
               configure script.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Language</title>

               <para>The scripting language used in
               <filename>configure.in</filename> is <command>sh</command>(1).
               All conditional statements must use the form:</para>

               <programlisting>if test "x$some_var" = "xsome_val" ; then
   ...
fi</programlisting>

               <para>rather than:</para>

               <programlisting>if [ "x$some_var" = "xsome_val" ] ; then
   ...
fi</programlisting>

               <para>The brackets are recognized as special characters by
               <command>m4</command>(1) and may not be copied into
               <filename>configure</filename> properly.</para>

               <para>When performing tests, it is recommended that some extra
               character be used to avoid passing any empty strings to the
               <command>test</command>(1) command. Some implementations do not
               deal well with empty strings when performing comparisons. In
               the above code examples, the character '<literal>x</literal>'
               was used at the beginning of the two strings. While there is
               still old code in various configure scripts that do not use
               this convention, it is recommended that all new code follow
               this rule. Furthermore, when editing legacy code that does not
               protect the string operands, it is recommended that the strings
               be updated accordingly.</para>

               <title>Parameters to Macros</title>

               <para>Parameters spanning multiple lines may be passed to
               Autoconf macros without using backslashes through a special
               block recognized by <command>m4</command>(1). Simply enclose
               the parameter in []'s and it will be parsed as one parameter.
               Some macros require the use of backslashes, however. In these
               cases, the argument is taken as a literal list used by
               <command>sh</command>(1) code. One such macro is
               <function>AC_CHECK_HEADERS()</function>.</para>

               <para>Beyond multi-line arguments, the Autoconf documentation
               recommends that <emphasis>all</emphasis> parameters passed to
               macros be enclosed in square brackets. This is to protect the
               arguments so that <command>m4</command>(1) does not mangle
               anything in its expansion of the macros. Consider the following
               examples:</para>

               <programlisting>AC_CONFIG_HEADER([vpr/vprDefines.h])
DPP_PREREQ([1.4.107])

DPP_PERL_VER([5.004], , , [AC_MSG_ERROR([*** Perl is required ***])])

AC_CHECK_PROG([MTREE_CMD], [mtree], [mtree], [\$(PERL) \$(scriptdir)/mtree.pl])

DPP_HAVE_GNU_MAKE([3.78], ,
    [AC_MSG_ERROR([*** The build system requires GNU make 3.78 or newer ***])])
DPP_BASIC_PROGS([$PLATFORM], [$OS_TYPE])</programlisting>

               <para>While this does make the code harder to read, it saves a
               lot of headache, especially between two different versions of
               Autoconf. Unfortunately, not all macro calls are as
               well-protected as those in the above example.

                     <primary>Doozer++</primary>

               usually caused by misuses in Juggler
               <filename>configure.in</filename> files.) It is recommended
               that all new code use square brackets. When editing exiting
               code, add brackets when necessary.</para>

               <para>Anything that defines preprocessor macros other than
               those generated by the Autoconf macros must be defined in the
               module's <filename>acconfig.h</filename>. If they are not
               defined in this file, <command>autoheader</command>(1) will
               complain as it parses <command>configure.in</command> and finds
               these customizations. Follow the existing syntax and layout of
               <filename>acconfig.h</filename> when making additions to it. In
               general, additions only have to be made when a new
               <function>AC_DEFINE()</function>,
               <function>AC_CHECK_TYPE()</function>, etc. line is added to
               <filename>configure.in</filename>.</para>

               <note>
                  <para>Autoconf versions since 2.50 discourage the use of

                  and as such, we cannot update to Autoconf 2.5x conventions.

            <title>Structure of a <filename>configure.in</filename>
            File</title>

            <para>We now move on to the basic structure of a
            <filename>configure.in</filename> file. As mentioned earlier, all
            configure scripts in the Juggler Project, save one, follow this
            basic structure. Each section is normally commented to distinguish
            its tasks from preceding and following sections.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Initialization</title>

               <para>The first short block of
               <filename>configure.in</filename> performs some very basic
               initialization tasks. The RCS revision number of the script is
               maintained here so that the user can verify that s/he has the
               most recent version of the actual configure script. A check for
               one file in the source tree is also made to perform a very
               general, inexact verification that things are where they are
               supposed to be. For example, VR Juggler's configure script will
               do its sanity check based on the existence of
               <filename>vrj/vrjConfig.h</filename>. Next, the header file
               created when done with the configuration process is named. In
               VR Juggler, this file is called
               <filename>vrj/vrjDefines.h</filename>. Finally,
               Doozer++<indexterm>
                     <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                  </indexterm> initialization occurs using the
               <function>DPP_INIT()</function> macro.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Custom Arguments</title>

               <para>In this block, the custom arguments for the configure
               script are defined. The first set defines the
               <option>--with-package[=arg]</option> and
               <option>--without-package</option> arguments. These are
               intended to be used for choosing some external software package
               to use at compile time. They are also used for providing a
               small level of customization to how the external software is
               found and/or used.</para>

               <para>The second set defines the
               <option>--enable-feature[=arg]</option> and
               <option>--disable-feature</option> arguments that allow the
               user to choose which optional features can be built. From the
               Autoconf 2.12 documentation, <quote>These options should never
               make a feature behave differently or cause one feature to
               replace another.</quote></para>

               <para>For both sets of options, the
               <function>AC_ARG_WITH()</function> and
               <function>AC_ARG_ENABLE()</function> macros behave the same
               way. The first argument is the package/feature. The second
               argument is the description printed when the user runs
               configure with the <option>--help</option> option. The third
               argument sets a user-defined variable in the script to the
               contents of <varname>$withval</varname> or
               <varname>$enableval</varname> respectively. If no argument is
               given (e.g., the user specified
               <option>--enable-opengl</option>), the variable will get either
               <quote>yes</quote> or <quote><type></type>no</quote> as its
               value depending upon whether the user used the positive or
               negative form of the argument.</para>

               <para>After the custom arguments are defined, some of the
               values that may be read are processed. In particular, the
               application binary interface (ABI) under which the module will
               be compiled is defined. This is done prior to the
               system-dependent section to reduce duplicated code even though
               the ABI is highly dependent upon the operating system and
               underlying computer architecture.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>System-Dependent Setup</title>

               <para>Here, a common set of script variables are given values
               that are usually dependent upon the system on which the script
               is being run. Except in VPR's configure script, there is little
               system-dependent code. Most of it is hidden by the
               Doozer++<indexterm>
                     <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                  </indexterm> <function>DPP_SYSTEM_SETUP()</function> macro.
               In the case of VPR's <filename>configure.in</filename>,
               however, a large conditional block compares the value in
               <varname>$target_os</varname> (obtained from the
               <function>AC_CANONICAL_TARGET()</function> macro) with known
               systems and sets values for the variables appropriately.</para>

               <para>Some existing variables may be modified here as well.
               These often include <varname>$CFLAGS</varname>,
               <varname>$CXXFLAGS</varname> and <varname>$INCLUDES</varname>.
               Each of these could have been set as part of the user's
               environment variables or previously in the script as part of
               executing a macro. Thus, they should be treated carefully so as
               not to destroy any existing values that may be stored in
               them.</para>

               <para>Besides setting values in variables, custom pre-processor
               macros are often defined here using the
               <function>AC_DEFINE()</function> macro. This macro takes two
               parameters:</para>

               <orderedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>The name of the macro to define.</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>The value to which the macro will be set by the
                     pre-processor.</para>
                  </listitem>
               </orderedlist>

               <para>To get something similar to:</para>

               <programlisting>#define VJ_DEF</programlisting>

               <para>use the following syntax:</para>

               <programlisting>AC_DEFINE([VJ_DEV],)</programlisting>

               <para>Defining macros that take parameters cannot be done with
               <function>AC_DEFINE()</function>. However, based on a check
               made for something (such as <function>sginap</function>(2)),
               such a macro can be defined at the bottom of
               <filename>acconfig.h</filename> or in the module's
               <filename>Config.h</filename>
               (<filename>vprConfig.h</filename>,
               <filename>tweekConfig.h</filename>, etc.) header after it
               includes the generated header.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>External Program Checks</title>

               <para>This block is for standard program checks that configure
               does to ensure that software needed for compiling the package
               works. Using the values in several preset variables (including
               <varname>$CC</varname> for the C compiler and
               <varname>$CXX</varname> for the C++ compiler), it runs tests on
               the software and reports any problems it finds.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>External Library Checks</title>

               <para>Checks for required external libraries are made here. In
               a configure script, a great deal of processing is often done in
               order to ensure that the source can be properly compiled and
               linked using certain external libraries. The basic process of
               checking for a library (say, the OpenGL library) involves first
               checking to see if the library can be linked. If the library
               can be linked, a check is then made for a standard header file
               associated with the library (in this case,
               <filename>GL/gl.h</filename>). In some cases, if a library
               cannot be found, a fallback check is provided. For example, in
               the case of the POSIX threads library, an attempt to link
               against <filename>libpthread</filename> is made. If that fails
               (as it will on HP-UX 10.20), a check is made to link against
               <filename>libcma</filename>.</para>

               <para>Upon successfully finding a library and a needed header
               file, several variables are usually set that are used later in
               the makefile generation phase. If a library is not found, the
               script may simply issue a warning about the problem or it may
               exit altogether if the library's existence is crucial to the
               compiling process.</para>

               <para>Adding new library checks can be complicated. The best
               method is to refer to the <ulink
               url="http://www.gnu.org/manual/autoconf/index.html">Autoconf
               documentation</ulink> and the existing checks. All follow
               basically the same structure.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Header File Checks</title>

               <para>Checks for standard header files and user-specified
               header files are made here. The user-specified list is a
               space-separated list of header files that may not exist on all
               systems. If a header file is found,
               <symbol>HAVE_FILENAME_H</symbol> is defined in the module's
               definition header (<filename>vprDefines.h</filename>,
               <filename>tweekDefines.h</filename>, etc.) when it is
               generated.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Library Function Checks</title>

               <para>Here, checks are made for any library and system
               functions (e.g., <function>gettimeofday</function>(3),
               <function>gethostbyname</function>(2),
               <function>usleep</function>(2)) that may not exist on all
               systems. As with other sections, the user-specified list of
               functions to check is the space-separated parameter passed to
               the <function>AC_CHECK_FUNCS()</function> macro. If found,
               <symbol>HAVE_FUNCNAME</symbol> will be defined in the generated
               definition header.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Makefile Substitution</title>

               <para>Within this block of configure.in, special symbols in the
               <filename>Makefile.in</filename> template files are slated for
               replacement with variable values. This is done through the
               <function>AC_SUBST()</function> macro, and it simply replaces a
               tag in a <filename>Makefile.in</filename> with the value stored
               in the corresponding configure script variable. The following
               example illustrates what happens during the file generation
               phase (discussed next). Say that some
               <filename>Makefile.in</filename> contains the following
               line:</para>

               <programlisting>CUSTOM_VAR = @CUSTOM_VAR@</programlisting>

               <para>The string enclosed by <literal>@</literal>'s is the tag
               that will be replaced when <filename>Makefile</filename> is
               generated. In <filename>configure.in</filename>, there
               following line must be present:</para>

               <programlisting>AC_SUBST(CUSTOM_VAR)</programlisting>

               <para>Note that the variable is not prepended by a
               `<literal>$</literal>' because variable interpolation should
               not be done here. Of course, <varname>$CUSTOM_VAR</varname>
               will generally have had some value set prior to this point.
               That is not required, however.</para>

               <para>It is in this phase of configuration that most of the
               system-dependent build work is done. This is similar to what
               Imake template files do. Virtually everything preceding this
               point set variables to have values appropriate to the host
               machine, and now they are put into the makefiles to be used for
               compiling the code. There are several pre-defined variables
               that <command>configure</command> will substitute in the input
               template files. Refer to the section titled <quote>Preset
               Output Variables</quote> in the Autoconf 2.13 documentation for
               a list of these.</para>

               <para>In this last block, file generation is performed using
               the <function>AC_OUTPUT()</function> macro. It iterates through
               its space-separated list of files and finds the associated
               <filename>.in</filename> template file. In general, this step
               is only used for generating makefiles (the module's definition
               header is added automatically due to the
               <function>AC_CONFIG_HEADER()</function> call at the top of
               <filename>configure.in</filename>). When a new directory and
               corresponding <filename>Makefile.in</filename> are added to the
               source tree, an entry for it must be added to this list.</para>

               <title>Tweek</title>

               <para>Tweek is an interesting case because it contains two
               distinct yet interoperable components: a C++ API and a Java
               API. It is possible to use one without the other, and it is
               even possible to configure Tweek so that neither is compiled.
               Of course, the latter is a rather odd case that usually only
               occurs when something went wrong during the execution of the
               configure script. Furthermore, Tweek can be compiled against
               any Java or C++ CORBA 2.3 (or newer) implementation. This is
               the result of using high-level CORBA standards and interfaces
               that allow ORBs swapped and allow ORBs from different vendors
               to communicate with each other.</para>

         <title>Extending a Module's Makefiles</title>

         <para>In this chapter, we explain how to extend a given module's
         makefiles. In most cases, all the modules in the Juggler Project use
         the same basic structure for their makefiles. Those that do not
         follow the existing conventions should be updated to ease maintenance
         issues. This chapter begins with a discussion of the basic ideas used
         in writing makefiles for a Juggler module. We then move on to the
         top-level glue makefile. Next, we discuss the individual component
         makefiles that typically perform the actual compiling steps. This
         chapter concludes with an examination of some specific modules to
         understand how different special cases are handled.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Makefile Conventions</title>

            <para>Due to the size of the Juggler Project code base, following
            conventions in all makefiles is very important. The uniformity
            makes it easier for anyone to maintain the various module build
            systems. If a given module does not follow the conventions,
            someone who does not have direct knowledge of that makefile may
            find it hard to fix problems that may occur. Furthermore,
            extensions to a given module's build system are more difficult if
            the same basic ideas cannot be shared across all modules. The
            following subsections cover most of the conventions currently in
            use.</para>

            <section>
               <title>File Names</title>

               <para>Due to Autoconf rules, all files that are to be generated
               by a configure script must have the suffix
               <filename>.in</filename>. Because of that, this is not so much
               a convention as it is a requirement. However, there are other
               files used in the build system, and their names are
               important.</para>

               <para>Makefile stubs that make variable assignments have the
               string <quote>defs</quote> somewhere in their name. In general,
               such makefile stubs do not define any targets, though this may
               not always be the case. Examples are
               <filename>make.defs.mk</filename>,
               <filename>common.defs.mk</filename><indexterm>
                     <primary>common.defs.mk</primary>
                  </indexterm> (a Doozer++<indexterm>
                     <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                  </indexterm> file), and
               <filename>test.defs.mk</filename>.</para>

               <para>In some cases, one makefile may include targets from
               another. The idea here is that the high-level tasks are defined
               in <filename>Makefile.in</filename>, and all the grunt work is
               done in the included file(s). Providing this separation can
               help casual viewers to understand the high-level tasks without
               worrying about all the behind-the-scenes details. The included
               files have the string <quote>inc</quote> in their name. The
               most common example seen in modules is
               <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename>, though there could be
               files such as <filename>Makefile.inc0.in</filename>,
               <filename>Makefile.inc1.in</filename>, and so on. The use of
               numbering allows multiple files to be used for separating the
               tasks.</para>

               <para>It is important to note that all of the makefiles named
               in the above examples begin with a capital letter. While it is
               often useful to include multiple makefiles in a single
               directory (of the Autoconf <filename>.in</filename> template
               variety and otherwise), there must never be a situation where a
               directory could contain the files <filename>Makefile</filename>
               and <filename>makefile</filename>. Win32 file systems cannot
               distinguish between the two, and only bad things can occur as a
               result.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Variable Assignments</title>

               <para>Recently, there has been a shift in the style used to
               perform variable assignments. The new style is based on the
               formatting used in all FreeBSD system and ports makefiles. This
               style was adopted to make formatting makefiles easier and
               cleaner. It is shown below:</para>

               <programlisting>VAR=		value
OPT_VAR?=	default-setting
LIST_VAR=	item1	\
		item2	\
		item3

LIST_VAR+=	item4</programlisting>

               <para>The key is the whitespace around the assignment
               operators. On the left-hand side, there is no whitespace; on
               the right-hand side, there are one or more tabs. When using
               multiple lines, tabs are used for indentation. Spaces are
               <emphasis>never</emphasis> used. Because tabs must be used in
               makefile targets, it is convenient (with most editors) to use
               tabs for all formatting characters.</para>

               <para>This convention is relatively new, and its adoption is
               not yet complete. Files that have not been updated should be
               reformatted when they are encountered.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Variable References</title>

               <para>Most implementations of <command>make</command>(1) allow
               the use of two variable reference styles. These are shown
               below:</para>

               <programlisting>VAR=	value

target:
	echo ${VAR}
	echo $(VAR)</programlisting>

               <para>In the first line of the target called
               '<literal>target</literal>', curly braces are used. This is the
               same syntax used to clarify variable interpolations in most
               shell scripting languages. The second line uses
               parentheses.</para>

               <para>In the Juggler Project, we prefer the use of parentheses
               over curly braces for the following reasons:</para>

               <orderedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>It distinguishes make variable references from
                     shell variable references. Since shell scripting can be
                     used to a limited degree in makefiles, this can be
                     important.</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>Some implementations of <command>make</command>(1)
                     only support this style. While the majority of the build
                     system is based on GNU make, some makefiles are designed
                     to work with any implementation. Having some makefiles
                     that use one style and others that make use of a
                     different style can be confusing. By choosing the style
                     that is supported by all implementations, we can never go
                     wrong.</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>The look of the parentheses is cleaner than the
                     curly braces. This, of course, is purely aesthetic, so it
                     does not make the best case during style discussions
                     (read, <quote>arguments</quote>).</para>
                  </listitem>

            <title>The Glue Makefile</title>

            <para>Each module in the Juggler Project has a <glossterm
            linkend="gloss.glue-makefile">glue makefile</glossterm> in its
            top-level directory that directs compilation of the module's main
            code base<footnote>
                  <para>Source code used for testing purposes of for sample
                  applications is handled independently of the main code base,
                  usually by a single makefile.</para>
               </footnote>. Every module's top-level makefile employs
            recursive calls to GNU make to build its code. The recursion
            occurs based on the source code directory structure. An iterative
            loop over each subdirectory is used make the recursive call to GNU
            make. Behind the scenes, all of this occurs within
            Doozer++<indexterm>
                  <primary>Doozer++</primary>
               </indexterm> makefile stubs, but it is directed by variable
            settings in the glue makefile.</para>

            <para>In this section, we will discuss how the glue makefiles work
            so that they may be extended correctly. We begin by explaining the
            basic structure employed by most of the glue makefiles found in
            the Juggler Project source tree. Learning how to extend those
            makefiles follows from that.</para>

               <title id="glue.makefile.struct.section">Basic
               Structure</title>

               <para>In all but one module in the Juggler Project, the basic
               structure of the glue makefile is the same: one makefile that
               defines high-level targets, and one included makefile that does
               all the work. In this subsection, we explain the way these two
               files work to make up the glue that holds a module's build
               system together. We begin with the simpler of the two:
               <filename>Makefile.in</filename>.</para>

               <section>
                  <title><filename>Makefile.in</filename></title>

                  <para>All modules have to have a
                  <filename>Makefile.in</filename> in their top-level source
                  directory. The real makefile is generated as part of
                  executing the configure script. In most cases, the contents
                  of this file is roughly the same. The file is divided into
                  sections, and we will examine each section in turn.</para>

                  <section>
                     <title>Define Default Target</title>

                     <para>As with most makefiles, the first thing done is the
                     definition of a default target, and the glue makefile is
                     no exception. In most cases, the default target is one
                     that is useful to developers. In Doozer++<indexterm>
                           <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                        </indexterm> terms, that target is
                     '<literal>debug</literal>'.</para>

                     <para>Definition of a default target unfortunately has
                     special significance if
                     <filename>dpp.subdir.mk</filename><indexterm>
                           <primary>dpp.subdir.mk</primary>
                        </indexterm> is used. In order for a recursive build
                     to execute based on its definition in Doozer++, the file
                     <filename>dpp.subdir.mk</filename> must have the special
                     target called '<literal>default</literal>'. Because it is
                     not possible with GNU make to test if a target has
                     already been defined, a workaround must be used. Namely,
                     the variable <varname>$(DEFAULT_SET)</varname> must be
                     defined if a makefile that includes
                     <filename>dpp.subdir.mk</filename> defines its own
                     '<literal>default</literal>' target. Thus, most top-level
                     <filename>Makefile.in</filename> files have the following
                     as the first three lines:</para>

                     <programlisting>default: debug

DEFAULT_SET=	1</programlisting>

                     <para>It is possible that some refactoring of
                     <filename>dpp.subdir.mk</filename> might eliminate the
                     need for this. As of this writing, it is not considered a
                     critical change.</para>

                     <title>Include Project-Wide Variable Settings</title>

                     <para>Since VR Juggler 1.0, the build system has
                     collected project-wide variable settings into a single
                     file so that it may be included by all makefiles in the
                     module's core build system. In VR Juggler 2.0, the
                     (Autoconf-generated) file is called
                     <filename>make.defs.mk</filename><footnote>
                           <para>A better name for this file might be
                           <filename>proj.defs.mk</filename> since its job is
                           to provide project-specific customizations in
                           addition to the common settings provided through the

                     <para>Once <filename>make.defs.mk</filename> has been
                     included, local variable settings are performed. These
                     can provide further customizations on variables set in
                     <filename>make.defs.mk</filename>, but usually, the
                     variables are used only within the scope of the glue
                     makefile. That is, the variables are needed exclusively
                     for directing the process of building the module source
                     code.</para>

                     <para>For example, a decision to build a certain subset
                     of the code base may be made at this level.
                     Alternatively, a decision about how to build the code may
                     be made. In most cases, such a decision is whether to
                     build profiled versions of the library (or
                     libraries).</para>

                     <para>The most important local variable setting is that
                     of the list of subdirectories in the module. This list is
                     provided through the <varname>$(SUBDIR)</varname>
                     variable. Due to the structure of the various modules in
                     the Juggler Project, there would be nothing to do without
                     providing Doozer++<indexterm>

                        </indexterm> with the list of subdirectories. The way
                     <varname>$(SUBDIR)</varname> is assigned its value may

                     <para>The main purpose of a project's
                     <filename>Makefile.in</filename> is the definition of

                     users and developers will run to compile the module. Such

                     defined manually; the third and fourth are inherited

                     <para>The high-level targets make use of low-level

                     <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename>, with all its ugly

                     <para>Finally, the top-level makefile must include the
                     external that usually have all the hard bits. In most

                  <para>In the context of the glue makefile, this particular
                  file is often quite complex. If there is any one place in a
                  module's build system that is hard to understand, it is
                  within this file. However, the whole purpose of having this
                  file is to collect all the complex build details into one
                  place that is <quote>out of the way</quote> in some
                  sense.</para>

                  <para>Due to the complexity and the wide variation in
                  requirements between modules, we cannot examine a specific
                  <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename> and still provide a
                  general explanation. Thus, we will review only the
                  commonalities. When possible, we will cover important
                  aspects that may not necessarily be used by all glue
                  makefiles. Before we do that, we will begin our discussion
                  with an review of the concepts behind
                  <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename> and why it is
                  important.</para>

                  <section>
                     <title>Basic Concepts</title>

                     <para>As has been stated previously, the fundamental idea
                     behind the top-level <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename>
                     is to hide complexity. More explicitly, this file should
                     contain targets that the user will not execute in most
                     circumstances. By putting such targets in this file, a
                     casual reader need not ever see the complexity of the
                     glue makefile. He or she should only have to open
                     <filename>Makefile.in</filename> (or the generated
                     <filename>Makefile</filename>) to get an understanding of
                     how the build works. Of course, some details are
                     encapsulated within Doozer++<indexterm>
                           <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                        </indexterm> makefile stubs, so getting a complete
                     understanding is not necessarily a straightforward
                     process. The extensive comments at the top of and
                     throughout <filename>Makefile.in</filename> (and
                     documents such as this) are there to fill in the
                     gaps.</para>

                     <para>While it is very difficult to separate all targets
                     cleanly based on common usage, there are some targets
                     that definitely fit into this file well. Such targets are
                     only called by Doozer++ through a mechanism similar to a
                     C callback. Users of the build system should rarely, if
                     ever, need to execute such targets, especially because
                     Doozer++ may set up a special execution environment for
                     the targets. Callback targets may include the
                     following:</para>

                           targets would include those used for building and
                           installing a module.</para>

                  <section>
                     <title>Library Name Construction</title>

                     <para>The responsibility for putting all the pieces
                     together for the final library names rests on this file.
                     Based on variable definitions in
                     <filename>make.defs.mk</filename> (see below), the final
                     library names must be defined so that Doozer++ knows what
                     to build. The configure script provides the
                     platform-specific details such as file extensions so that
                     the code in <filename>Makefile.inc</filename> is
                     relatively simple. For example, assuming the existence of
                     a variable <varname>$(MY_LIBRARY)</varname>, the
                     following provides all the information needed to direct
                     the compilation of profiled and non-profiled libraries,
                     of both the static and the dynamic variety:</para>

                     <programlisting>STATICLIB_EXT=	@STATICLIB_EXT@
DYNAMICLIB_EXT=	@DYNAMICLIB_EXT@

LIBS=		$(MY_LIBRARY)
STATIC_LIBS=	$(LIBS)
DYNAMIC_LIBS=	$(LIBS)</programlisting>

                     <para>Using the above variables (and more settings from
                     <filename>make.defs.mk</filename>), we can construct the
                     names of various library versions. These names are then
                     used internally for the targets that build the actual
                     libraries. The name construction is performed as
                     follows:</para>

                     <programlisting>MY_LIB_STATIC=		$(MY_LIBRARY).$(STATICLIB_EXT)
MY_LIB_DYNAMIC=		$(MY_LIBRARY).$(DYNAMICLIB_EXT)
MY_PROF_LIB_STATIC=	$(MY_LIBRARY)$(PROFLIB_EXT).$(STATICLIB_EXT)
MY_PROF_LIB_DYNAMIC=	$(MY_LIBRARY)$(PROFLIB_EXT).$(DYNAMICLIB_EXT)</programlisting>

                     <note>
                        <para>The above hinges on the fact that
                        <varname>$(PROFLIB_EXT)</varname> is non-empty.
                        Otherwise, the targets we will examine in the next
                        section would not be named correctly. If profiled
                        libraries are not supported by the rest of the
                        module's build system, do not use the profiled
                        variants shown above.</para>

                     <title>Library Build Targets</title>

                     <para>Once we know the names of the libraries we will
                     build, we can define the targets that actually build
                     them. In nearly every case, these targets are very close
                     to being identical between modules. Only rarely are there
                     module-specific variations. The following shows targets
                     for building static profiled and non-profiled versions of
                     <varname>$(MY_LIBRARY)</varname>:</para>

                        <para>Most modules in the Juggler Project define their
                        static library target slightly differently than the
                        above. As of this writing, static libraries are not
                        built on Win32 platforms because there is no easy way
                        for the build system to distinguish between a

                  <section>
                     <title>Installation Extension Targets</title>

                     <para>Most modules in the Juggler Project install more
                     than just libraries and header files. Data files, sample
                     programs, and other useful bits may be installed as well.
                     Even before something can be installed, an installation
                     directory hierarchy usually needs to be in place.
                     Doozer++<indexterm>
                           <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                        </indexterm> offers features for the basic
                     installation and for extending the installation. In this
                     section, we explain how and why modules in the Juggler
                     Project extend the basic Doozer++ installation
                     capabilities.</para>

                     <para>First, all modules are required to ensure that the
                     installation hierarchy they need exists before
                     installing. This is accomplished by telling Doozer++ that
                     a '<literal>beforeinstall</literal>' target exists as
                     follows:</para>

                     <programlisting>BEFOREINSTALL=	beforeinstall

beforeinstall:
	&lt;create installation hierarchy&gt;</programlisting>

                     <para>If the variable <varname>$(BEFOREINSTALL)</varname>
                     is defined, the Doozer++ installation targets will invoke
                     the target(s) defined in
                     <varname>$(BEFOREINSTALL)</varname> before installing
                     anything (hence the name). (Using this technique is
                     necessary because GNU make provides no way for makefiles
                     to determine if a target has been defined.) Most modules
                     make use of <command>mtree</command>(1) (or the
                     work-alike Perl script) to create the installation
                     hierarchy in a target called '<literal>hier</literal>'.
                     More information about the <command>mtree</command>(1)
                     command is available in <xref
                     linkend="helper.scripts.appendix" />.</para>

                     <para>Next, modules may need to take extra steps before
                     installing specific builds of the libraries (such as
                     those built by the targets '<literal>dbg</literal>',
                     '<literal>prof-dso</literal>', etc.). This need is
                     indicated as follows:</para>

                     <programlisting>PREINSTALL=	pre-install

pre-install:
	&lt;perform steps immediately prior to library installation&gt;</programlisting>

                     <para>If GNU make were more expressive, the above would
                     probably be done using targets such as
                     '<literal>pre-dbg-install</literal>',
                     '<literal>pre-prof-dso-install</literal>', and so
                     on.</para>

                     <para>The complement of pre-installation is
                     post-installation. Availability of custom
                     post-installation targets is specified using the
                     <varname>$(POSTINSTALL)</varname> variable. However, in
                     Doozer++ 1.5, there is some inconsistency with the use of
                     post-installation targets. They do not correspond exactly
                     to the pre-installation targets, and for that reason,
                     some refactoring is needed. In Doozer++ 1.5, the
                     post-installation targets are executed after a full
                     installation is done rather than after each library
                     version is installed. For that reason, the current
                     <varname>$(POSTINSTALL)</varname> variable should
                     probably be renamed to
                     <varname>$(POSTLIBSINSTALL)</varname> or some variant
                     thereof. The current post-installation target always
                     installs the module's header files and then runs any
                     custom post-installation steps. It is at this point that
                     most modules install their data files, sample programs,
                     and other necessary/helpful files.</para>

                     <para>Finally, the complement of
                     <varname>$(BEFOREINSTALL)</varname> is executed. It is
                     specified using the variable
                     <varname>$(AFTERINSTALL)</varname>. Considering that most
                     modules use <varname>$(POSTINSTALL)</varname> for data
                     file installation, there is not much left for
                     <varname>$(AFTERINSTALL)</varname> to do.</para>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                     <title>Developer Installation Targets</title>

                     <para>At long last, we have reached the point where we
                     explain how the developer installation is created. All
                     the modules in the Juggler Project are required to set up
                     a developer installation, though they are free to
                     implement it any way they want. The only restriction is
                     that the modules must not touch or otherwise modify the
                     developer installations of previously built modules. As
                     was stated in <xref linkend="instlinks.section" />, the
                     idea here is to create something that <emphasis>looks
                     like</emphasis> a full installation within the
                     developer's build tree. No special steps should be taken
                     that would cause the developer installation to look or
                     behave any differently than a full installation.</para>

                     <para>As explained in <xref
                     linkend="global.build.chapter" />, all modules must
                     define targets that set up and tear down the developer
                     installation. The set-up target is always called
                     '<literal>links</literal>', and it can be implemented
                     exactly as follows:</para>

                     <programlisting linenumbering="numbered">instlinks=	$(topdir)/instlinks
AFTERBUILD=	afterbuild

afterbuild:
	@$(MAKE) links

links:
ifdef BUILD_TYPE
	$(MAKE) links-$(BUILD_TYPE)
else
	$(MAKE) links-all
endif

links-all:
	@$(MAKE) EXTRA_INSTALL_ARGS=-l prefix="$(instlinks)" installworld

links-dbg:
	@$(MAKE) EXTRA_INSTALL_ARGS=-l prefix="$(instlinks)" install-debug

links-opt:
	@$(MAKE) EXTRA_INSTALL_ARGS=-l prefix="$(instlinks)" install-optim

links-prof:
	@$(MAKE) EXTRA_INSTALL_ARGS=-l prefix="$(instlinks)" install-profiled

clean-links:
ifndef GLOBAL_BUILD
	rm -rf $(instlinks)
endif</programlisting>

                     <para>The above makes use of a key feature
                     Doozer++<indexterm>
                           <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                        </indexterm> 1.5: the <varname>$(BUILD_TYPE)</varname>
                     variable. When the target '<literal>afterbuild</literal>'
                     is invoked, Doozer++ tells the target what type of build
                     was just performed using this variable. Based on that,
                     the '<literal>links</literal>' target can execute the
                     right installation.</para>

                     <note>
                        <para>The <varname>$(instlinks)</varname> variable
                        (which must be used as the prefix for the developer
                        installation) will be overridden by the global build
                        so that all modules make their developer installations
                        in the same directory. The setting on line 1 of the
                        above block provides the default value. This is useful
                        when the module is being build standalone (i.e.,
                        without using the global build).</para>
                     </note>

                     <para>When performing that installation, another Doozer++
                     1.5 feature is used: the BSD-compatible
                     <command>install</command>(1) script. Prior to Doozer++
                     1.5, installations were done under the assumption that
                     <command>install-sh</command> might have to be used if a
                     BSD-compatible <command>install</command>(1) command was
                     not available. The <command>install-sh</command> script
                     is only partially compatible with BSD
                     <command>install</command>(1), and because of limitations
                     in that script, installations could be very slow and
                     complex, even when the <command>install</command>(1)
                     command was available. Doozer++ 1.5 ships with a Perl
                     script called <command>bsd-install.pl</command> that is
                     fully compatible with BSD <command>install</command>(1),
                     and it adds a handy extra feature: symlink creation. When
                     the <option>-l</option> option is passed, and the target
                     OS supports symlinks, symlinks to the source files are
                     created instead of making copies of the files. This is
                     exactly what is needed for developer installations, and
                     the above '<literal>links-*</literal>' targets make use
                     of that option through the Doozer++-recognized variable
                     <varname>$(EXTRA_INSTALL_ARGS)</varname>.</para>

               <title>Auxiliary Files</title>

               <para>We now turn our attention to axillary files used by the
               glue makefile and the component makefiles (discussed in <xref
               linkend="component.makefile.section" />). Most modules have
               only two axillary makefiles in their top-level directory:
               <filename>common.defs.mk.in</filename> and
               <filename>make.defs.mk.in</filename>. We discuss only those two
               files here; any extra files are project-specific and could
               probably be merged into <filename>make.defs.mk.in</filename> or
               <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename> somehow.</para>

               <section>

                  <para>This is a file that comes with Doozer++<indexterm>
                        <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                     </indexterm> (in the <filename>examples</filename>
                  directory). It provides a (nearly) comprehensive list of all
                  the variables that may be defined by Autoconf macros in
                  Doozer++. The idea is that a project developer can make use
                  of this file with Doozer++ macros so that he or she does not
                  have to know all the variables that may be substituted by
                  the macros. In addition to the variable settings, there is
                  some code at the bottom of this file for handling different
                  ABIs, though at some point, this may move into a formal
                  Doozer++ makefile stub.</para>

                  <para>This file performs three simple tasks:</para>

                  <orderedlist>
                     <listitem>
                        <para>Include

                     </listitem>
                  </orderedlist>

                  <para>In reality, these two steps are usually reversed in
                  the actual file, but it makes more sense to discuss them
                  using the above ordering.</para>

                  <section>
                     <title>Include
                     <filename>common.defs.mk</filename></title>

                     <para>Including common.defs.mk is a relatively
                     straightforward operation. As of this writing, all
                     modules have the following as the last line of their
                     <filename>make.defs.mk.in</filename> file:</para>

                     <programlisting>include $(topdir)/common.defs.mk</programlisting>

                     <para>The variable <varname>$(topdir)</varname> is
                     available through an assignment made earlier in the
                     file:</para>

                     <programlisting>topdir=	@topdir@</programlisting>

                     <para>The use of <varname>$(topdir)</varname>, which
                     always has an absolute path, is required so that this
                     file can be included by any other makefile in the
                     module's source tree.</para>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                     <title>Provide Project-Specific Customizations</title>

                     <para>Project-specific customizations are made using the
                     extension mechanisms build into variable assignments in
                     <filename>common.defs.mk</filename><indexterm>
                           <primary>common.defs.mk</primary>
                        </indexterm>. In all cases, a variable whose name
                     begins with <literal>EXTRA_</literal> is used to extend
                     another variable's default settings. For example,
                     <varname>$(CXXFLAGS)</varname> is extended using
                     <varname>$(EXTRA_CXXFLAGS)</varname>. Extensions can be
                     performed using the += operator, though such operations
                     should be performed after
                     <filename>common.defs.mk</filename> is included.</para>
                  </section>

                  <section>
                     <title>Name the Library (or Libraries)</title>

                     <para>This is actually part of the project-specific
                     customizations, but it is important to distinguish it so
                     that it is not overlooked. The basic idea here is that
                     one or more variables, one for each C/C++ library, will
                     be defined. These variables will contain the basic name
                     of the library without any extensions or version
                     information. Furthermore, the library name will vary
                     correctly based on the target platform. On UNIX-based
                     systems, that means that the library will have the prefix
                     <quote>lib</quote>, and on Win32 platforms, there will be
                     no prefix. For example:</para>

                     <programlisting>TWEEK_LIBRARY=	@LIB_PREFIX@tweek</programlisting>

                     <para>The library name variables will be used by
                     <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename> when constructing
                     the list of libraries that Doozer++<indexterm>
                           <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                        </indexterm> must build.</para>

               <title>Extension</title>

               <para>Unless there are dramatic changes to the way
               Doozer++<indexterm>
                     <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                  </indexterm> does its job at the time of compilation, the
               file <filename>Makefile.in</filename> will remain fairly
               static. Extensions should almost always go in
               <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename> or
               <filename>make.defs.mk.in</filename>, depending on the nature
               of the extensions. User changes should
               <emphasis>never</emphasis> be made to
               <filename>common.defs.mk.in</filename><indexterm>
                     <primary>common.defs.mk</primary>
                  </indexterm>. This file provides a reasonably complete set
               of variables for extending its behavior, and
               <filename>make.defs.mk.in</filename> serves as an ideal place
               to perform overrides to any settings made in
               <filename>common.defs.mk.in</filename>. The real problem occurs
               when it is necessary to copy a modified version of
               <filename>common.defs.mk.in</filename> from Doozer++. Merging
               local changes can be hard unless
               <filename>common.defs.mk.in</filename> is always imported onto
               a CVS vendor branch.</para>

            <title>Individual Component Makefiles</title>

            <para>The recursion performed by the glue makefile would have
            nothing to do were it not for the component makefiles in each
            subdirectory. The job of these files is to provide the list of
            source files that must be compiled. When the recursion comes to a
            given subdirectory, a target ('<literal>dbg</literal>',
            '<literal>opt</literal>', etc.) is executed. Based on that target,
            the compiler argument list is constructed, and the source files
            are compiled iteratively (or in parallel depending on arguments
            given to <command>make</command>(1)).</para>

            <para>In most cases, the targets are defined in Doozer++<indexterm>

               </indexterm>. It is up to the build system author to ensure
            that the right makefile stubs are used together. Doozer++ 1.5
            provides only a few such stubs, and they all cooperate well. For
            example, <filename>dpp.libs.mk</filename><indexterm>

               <title>Basic Structure</title>

               <para>In the following sub-subsections, we examine the basic
               structure of a component makefile. This is almost a
               line-by-line examination of a given makefile. We concentrate
               our discussion on the compilation of C/C++ code since that
               makes up the majority of the Juggler Project. Java and IDL are
               handled somewhat differently, though the basic ideas are the
               same. The major difference is that no dependency files are
               generated for Java or IDL using Doozer++<indexterm>
                     <primary>Doozer++</primary>

                  <title>Default Target</title>

                  <para>The default target should be defined before doing
                  anything else. This prevents any external files that are
                  included from inadvertently defining a target that would be
                  implicitly defined as the default target. In most cases, the
                  default target will be '<literal>all</literal>' or
                  '<literal>debug</literal>'.</para>

               <section>
                  <title>Include <filename>make.defs.mk</filename></title>

                  <para>The next step should be to include
                  <filename>make.defs.mk</filename> to get all of its variable
                  definitions. Some of these may be needed later in the
                  execution of the including file, so it should be included as
                  early as possible. It should always be included using the
                  following syntax for the path:</para>

                  <programlisting>include @topdir@/make.defs.mk</programlisting>

                  <para>This will ensure that the path is specified correctly
                  when the actual makefile is generated. Once
                  <filename>make.defs.mk</filename> is included,
                  <varname>$(MKPATH)</varname> can be used for including files
                  in the <filename>Doozer++/mk</filename> directory of the
                  source tree.</para>

               <section>
                  <title>Preset and <quote>Local</quote> Variables</title>

                  <para>The first set of assignments is for preset variables
                  (that is, those that are substituted by
                  <command>configure</command> when the makefile is generated)
                  and for variables that are closely related to the preset
                  variety. In general, many of these variables will have
                  values that are specific to the current makefile. In other
                  words, they cannot be shared via a common file that would be
                  included by all makefiles.</para>

                  <para>Depending on which makefile is being examined, any
                  extra <quote>miscellaneous</quote> variables needed are also
                  set here. For the most part, everything set here is local to
                  the current file.</para>

                  <para>There are several significant variables that must be
                  set. They are as follows:</para>

                  <variablelist>
                     <varlistentry>
                        <term>includedir</term>

                           <varname>$(INSTALL_FILES)</varname> variable (see
                           below).</para>

                        <listitem>
                           <para>The directory containing the source code to be
                           compiled. Normally, this is assigned a value based
                           on the <literal>@srcdir@</literal> substitution
                           variable.</para>
                        </listitem>
                     </varlistentry>

                     <varlistentry>

                           distributed with Autoconf. In that case, the path
                           will be relative, and it will vary with each level
                           of nesting in the source tree.</para>

                  <para>There are also some optional variables that may be
                  necessary depending on the circumstances. They are:</para>

                  <para>Next, we provide the list of source files that will be
                  compiled. This is also used by
                  <command>makedepend</command>(1) (or other
                  dependency-generating tool) to get dependencies. For C++
                  code, the list of sources must be assigned to the
                  <varname>$(SRCS)</varname> variable. These file names should
                  not have any path prepended to them. When the dependencies
                  (the so-called <quote><filename>.d</filename> files</quote>)

                  that are not compiled into the module's library but are
                  used, for example, as test code. This is one example of a
                  time when it may be convenient to compile code in the
                  current directory rather than in a common object file
                  directory. Generally, these targets will be similar to the
                  library targets; however, dependencies will not be generated
                  for these files. The Doozer++<indexterm>
                        <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                     </indexterm> dependency-generation code only looks at
                  <varname>$(SRCS)</varname>. A local target for generating
                  dependencies could be defined if so desired.</para>

                  <title>Dependencies</title>

                  <para>Most <filename>Makefile.in</filename> files end with
                  an area where all the source dependencies are loaded via the
                  GNU make include mechanism. In general, it appears as
                  follows:</para>

                  <programlisting>-include $(DEPEND_FILES)</programlisting>

                  <para>The variable <varname>$(DEPEND_FILES)</varname> is
                  constructed by Doozer++<indexterm>
                        <primary>Doozer++</primary>
                     </indexterm> based on the list of C/C++ sources (see
                  <xref linkend="list.srcs.section" /> above). The use of
                  <literal>-include</literal> versus
                  <literal>include</literal> silences warnings when the
                  dependency files have not been created yet.</para>

                  <para>Some makefiles wrap the line using GNU make
                  conditional constructs. In particular, most component
                  makefiles actually use the following line:</para>

                  <programlisting>ifndef DO_CLEANDEPEND
   -include $(DEPEND_FILES)
endif</programlisting>

                  <para>This is a workaround for a deficiency in GNU make.
                  Namely, the target that is being executed cannot be tested.
                  As a result, cleaning up dependencies with the
                  '<literal>cleandepend</literal>' target is not
                  straightforward. Doozer++ defines that target, and when it
                  is executed, it defines the variable
                  <varname>$(DO_CLEANDEPEND)</varname>. If, at some point, GNU
                  make had features to test the target being executed, this
                  workaround (and many, many others) could be removed.</para>

               done using conditional constructs or extending the always-build
               list depends on the circumstances. Other extensions may come in
               the form of new files that may be generated from an IDL file or

         <title>Helper Scripts</title>

         <para>The VR Juggler build system makes use of many, many helper
         scripts. Most are written in Perl, though a few are written in
         <command>sh</command>(1) because their task is very simple. In this
         appendix, we present information on how each script fits into the
         larger picture of the VR Juggler <quote>global</quote> build
         system.</para>

               <primary>mtree.pl</primary>
            </indexterm>

            <para><command>mtree</command>(1) is a utility for mapping
            directory hierarchies. It dates back to 4.3BSD-Reno, and
            development of it has continued in FreeBSD and in NetBSD.
            <command>mtree.pl</command> is a Perl script written to mimic the
            behavior of <command>mtree</command>(1) (the version distributed
            with FreeBSD 3.0) so that Juggler's installation can take
            advantage of its features on platforms without
            <command>mtree</command>(1). The two are not completely
            functionally equivalent at this time, but the basic features
            needed by VR Juggler are present.</para>

            <para>The key aspect of <command>mtree</command>(1) that the
            Juggler installation uses is the creation of directory hierarchies
            from specification files (named with the extension
            <filename>.dist</filename>). These specifications can be used to
            create the full installation tree with all directories guaranteed
            to have the same permissions and ownership. The actual
            specification files are generated by <command>configure</command>
            from template files to allow maximum flexibility. One key file,
            <filename>VJ.lib.dist</filename>, is generated by
            <command>configure</command> from scratch (i.e., without a
            template) so that it can take advantage of
            <command>configure</command>'s internal knowledge about the target
            platform.</para>

            <para><command>mtree</command>(1) provides a wide range of
            features but unfortunately, not all are implemented in
            <command>mtree.pl</command>. For example, besides being used to
            build a hierarchy, it can be used to generate a specification file
            for an existing hierarchy. For more information about what can be
            done with this utility, refer to the manual page if
            <command>mtree</command>(1) is distributed with the operating
            system. More work on bringing the two closer together in
            functional equivalence is anticipated.</para>

            <para>This Perl 5 script is used to install an entire directory
            tree without any of the <filename>CVS</filename> directories. Its
            use is very simple. In general, the base of the tree to be
            installed and the destination directory are all that is necessary.
            The basic usage is:</para>

            </cmdsynopsis>

            <para>This script is used when an entire directory (except for
            CVS-related files) must be installed. No other files are skipped
            during the installation process. Therefore, it is useful when a
            data directory must be installed.</para>

            <para>The <option>-e &lt;extension list&gt;</option> option shown
            above restricts install-dir.pl so that it installs only the files
            in the extension list. The extension list is a comma-separated
            list of extensions of the form <literal>.ext</literal>.</para>

            <para>Similar to <command>install-dir.pl</command>, this script
            installs the contents of a directory tree to a specified location.
            It is, however, more selective in what it installs. Only source
            files of <emphasis>case-insensitive</emphasis> recognized types
            (<filename>.txt</filename>, <filename>.c</filename>,
            <filename>.h</filename>, <filename>.cxx</filename>,
            <filename>.cpp</filename>, makefiles,
            <filename>Makefile.in</filename> files, and so on) are copied from
            the source to the destination. Any <filename>CVS</filename>
            directories are not copied over. The options for this script are
            as follows:</para>

            </cmdsynopsis>

            <para>In addition to the hard-coded list of extensions, users can
            provide their own extensions using <option>-e &lt;extension
            list&gt;</option> where &lt;extension list&gt; is a
            comma-separated string of extensions of the form
            <literal>.ext</literal>. Of course, if the extension list gets
            long enough, it might be worthwhile to consider using
            <command>install-dir.pl</command> instead.</para>

            <note>
               <para>With time and changing requirements in individual
               modules, the scripts <command>install-src.pl</command> and
               <command>install-dir.pl</command> have grown closer and closer
               to each other in their functionality. While they do share code
               through the <literal>InstallOps</literal> Perl module, there is
               some duplication. At this point, the only real difference
               between the two is that <command>install-src.pl</command> has a
               preset list of recognized extensions. This list could be passed
               to <command>install-dir.pl</command>, or
               <command>install-dir.pl</command> could be extended to enable
               this preset list in addition to anything passed in with
               <option>-e</option>.</para>

               <primary>makefiles-gen.pl</primary>
            </indexterm>

            <para>This script is used to perform the same functions as
            <command>configure</command> when it expands the
            <quote><literal>@...@</literal></quote> strings in
            <filename>.in</filename> template files. Its use is reserved for
            the installation phase rather than the configuration phase. The
            installation process copies over many
            <filename>Makefile.in</filename>'s that
            <command>configure</command> would normally generate for use by
            developers. To simplify maintenance, the same template files are
            used for installations that users can access. Since the templates
            still contain the <quote><literal>@...@</literal></quote> strings,
            they must be expanded again. Thus,
            <command>makefiles-gen.pl</command> steps in for this
            purpose.</para>

            <para>Options for <literal>makefiles-gen.pl</literal> are slightly
            different from any of the other scripts. It uses GNU-style options
            for the sake of clarity since some of the options correspond
            directly to a <quote><literal>@...@</literal></quote> string to be
            expanded. The options described here are required unless otherwise
            noted.</para>

            <para>The key to this script is <filename>VARS.pl.in</filename>,
            located in the top-level VR Juggler source directory. It is a Perl
            file that can be evaluated at run time by the script to set values
            used for substitution. The format used in the file is:</para>

            <programlisting>$VARS{'<emphasis>VAR_NAME</emphasis>'} = '@<emphasis>VAR_NAME</emphasis>@';</programlisting>

            <para>Note that <literal>VAR_NAME</literal> should be the same in
            both places for ease of understanding. The
            <varname>%VARS</varname> hash is used in the substitution process.
            Occurrences of its keys found in a
            <filename>Makefile.in</filename> are replaced with the value
            associated with that key (the expanded
            <quote><literal>@...@</literal></quote> string). Also note the use
            of apostrophes to prevent expansion of variables by the Perl
            interpreter. Be careful to use the right string delimiters when
            adding new values.</para>

            <para>Many of these Perl scripts use the
            <literal>InstallOps</literal> module (found in
            <filename>InstallOps.pm</filename> with the other scripts). This
            module provides subroutines implementing commonly used techniques
            in working with directory trees and files during installation.
            Ideally, it is general enough to be used in writing new scripts
            that can be added to the installation process. A short description
            of the available subroutines and their use is provided
            here.</para>

The second argument, <varname>$base_inst_dir</varname>, names the base directory to which the files will be installed. This routine requires that the calling package define a subroutine called <function>recurseAction()</function> that defines what actions to take when a normal file is encountered during the recursion process. It is only called when non-directory type files are found in the current directory of the recursion process. Since this is specialized for installation, it ensures that the destination directories (rooted at <varname>$base_inst_dir</varname>) exist.</funcsynopsisinfo>

            </indexterm>

            <para>This is a simple script used by most of the modules to
            generate a header file defining version information for the
            module. It reads the <filename>VERSION</filename> file used by all
            modules to create this header. Its usage is as follows:</para>

            <cmdsynopsis>
               <command>make-ver.sh</command>

               <group>

               </group>
            </cmdsynopsis>

            <para>The following shows a typical usage in a makefile:</para>

            <programlisting>PARAM_HEADER=	proj/projParam.h
BRANCH=		HEAD
CANON_NAME=	Chef
VER_ARGS=	-f $(PROJROOT_ABS)/VERSION -s @VPR_SUBSYSTEM@	\
		-b $(BRANCH) -o $(PARAM_HEADER) -n "$(CANON_NAME)"	\
		-i $(PROJROOT_ABS)/proj/projParam.h.in		\
		-d "`date '+%b %e, %Y %H:%M:%S'`"

BEFOREBUILD=	beforebuild

beforebuild:
	@$(MAKE) $(PARAM_HEADER)

$(PARAM_HEADER): $(PROJROOT_ABS)/proj/projParam.h.in $(PROJROOT_ABS)/VERSION
	@$(SHELL) $(scriptdir)/make-ver.sh $(VER_ARGS)</programlisting>

            <para>The above would normally occur in a module's top-level
            <filename>Makefile.inc.in</filename> file. It only generates the
            header <filename>proj/projParam.h</filename> when the source
            template changes or the module's <filename>VERSION</filename> file
            changes. Because it is generated during
            '<literal>beforebuild</literal>', it is guaranteed to exist when
            any C/C++ code would need to include it for proper
            compiling.</para>

            <para>This script basically serves as a way to generate the
            version information at build time rather than at configuration
            time using the configure script. Clearly, the use of a
            <filename>.in</filename> template file would be suited well to
            life as a <command>configure</command>-generated file, but the
            needs of the Juggler Project dictate that version information be
            up to date for builds since they are done more frequently than
            configurations.</para>

            <para>This is a script that can generate Doozer++<indexterm>
                  <primary>Doozer++</primary>
               </indexterm>-aware makefiles. It can generate two types of
            makefiles: module component makefiles and application makefiles.
            (The component makefiles of modules in the Juggler Project were
            discussed in <xref linkend="component.makefile.section" />.) The
            script also makes use of information provided through m4 macros
            defined in
            <filename>juggler/macros/vrj-helpers.m4</filename><indexterm>
                  <primary>vrj-helpers.m4</primary>
               </indexterm>. For that reason, it cannot be distributed with
            Doozer++. In other words, this script is tailored for use within
            the Juggler Project build system and cannot be used outside of
            that scope without modification.</para>

            <para>Use of this script is rather complicated, but it is probably
            easier than writing the makefiles by hand. Due to the complex
            nature, it is recommended that interested readers refer to the
            usage information printed by executing the following:</para>

            <screen>mkmakefile.pl --help</screen>

            <para>The output is quite comprehensive, and any usage information
            included within this document would simply be verbatim copies of
            that output. However, the following explanation, taken from the

            conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any
            such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
            is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify

            copyright law.</para>

            <para id="gfdl-mod-ver">A "Modified Version" of the Document means
            any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
            verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
            language.</para>

            <para id="gfdl-secnd-sect">A "Secondary Section" is a named
            appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals
            exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of
            the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
            matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that
            overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of
            mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
            The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
            the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
            philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
            them.</para>

            <para id="gfdl-inv-sect">The "Invariant Sections" are certain
            Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of
            Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is
            released under this License. If a section does not fit the above
            definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as
            Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If
            the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there
            are none.</para>

            <para id="gfdl-cov-text">The "Cover Texts" are certain short
            passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or
            Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is
            released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5
            words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</para>

            <para id="gfdl-transparent">A "Transparent" copy of the Document
            means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose
            specification is available to the general public, that is suitable
            for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text
            editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
            or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
            is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
            translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
            formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
            whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or
            discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
            An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial
            amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
            "Opaque".</para>

            <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
            plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
            format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
            standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
            human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include
            PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
            can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
            or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
            available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
            produced by some word processors for output purposes only.</para>

            <para id="gfdl-title-page">The "Title Page" means, for a printed
            book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are
            needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to
            appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have
            any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most
            prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning
            of the body of the text.</para>

            <para id="gfdl-entitled">A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named
            subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or
            contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in
            another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name
            mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications",
            "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a
            section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
            section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

            <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the

            warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers
            may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this

            the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
            distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
            copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must
            also follow the conditions in section 3.</para>

            <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that
            commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than
            100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
            must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
            all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
            Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly
            and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The
            front cover must present the full title with all words of the
            title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on
            the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the
            covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
            satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
            other respects.</para>

            <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
            fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
            reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto

            <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document

            state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
            which the general network-using public has access to download
            using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
            copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
            latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
            begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
            this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
            location until at least one year after the last time you
            distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or

            <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include
            a copy of the License in the document and put the following
            copyright and license notices just after the title page:</para>

               test the functionality of software development tools such as
               compilers and of local software installations. The results of
               the tests can be used to configure a software build system to
               work with the local system setup. Autoconf-generated scripts
               aid in the development of cross-platform software by detecting
               and managing platform-specific idiosyncrasies. Autoconf is part
               of the GNU software distribution.</para>

---------- ------------ -------------------------------------------------------
2010-07-08 patrickh     Do not set $LIBBITSUF if it already has a value. This
                        allows easy overriding from the execution environment.
                        NEW VERSION: 2.2.1
2010-07-08 patrickh     Do not use lib64 by default on Debian/Ubuntu x86_64.
2010-05-29 patrickh     Fixed compatibility with Autoconf 2.64 and newer. This
                        required splitting the functionality of the macros
                        DPP_PROG_CC and DPP_PROG_CXX into
                        DPP_CHECK_CC_FALLBACKS & DPP_PROG_CC and
                        DPP_CHECK_CXX_FALLBACKS & DPP_PROG_CXX. The former
                        accepts the same arguments as the 2.1 Doozer++ version
                        of the latter.
                        NEW VERSION: 2.2.0

                        report the directory containing the library (or
                        libraries) for the package.
                        NEW VERSION: 2.1.7

2003-05-23 patrickh     Merged the compiler warning level features from
                        RELENG_1_5.

                        --with-oalroot to --with-opengl and --with-openal

2002-08-16 patrickh     Separated compiler-sepcific setup from system-specific
                        setup.  There is now a macro called DPP_COMPILER_SETUP

                        version number is the first argument.  All the other
                        arguments have been "shifted over" one position.  This
                        was merged from the 1.5 release branch.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.2
2002-04-06 patrickh     Improved support for forcing the use of GCC for
                        compiling.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.1
2002-04-03 patrickh     Moved package-detection macros into pkgs, a new

                        NEW VERSION: 1.99.0
2002-12-14 patrickh     Added the ability to specify the path to the NSPR
                        headers in the DPP_HAVE_NSPR macro through the use of
                        a new command line option (--with-nspr-includes).  Part
                        of this change included a modifcation to the argument
                        list of DPP_NSPR_VER.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.101
2002-01-13 subatomic    Added tests for CppUnit and Boost.
2002-01-02 patrickh     Added dpp.simple-app.mk, a backend makefile stub for
                        compiling a single application from a (potentially
                        complex) source base.
2002-01-02 patrickh     Fixed DPP_VERSION_COMPARE for all platforms.  ksh(1) is
                        no longer required at all on Solaris.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.99
2001-12-19 patrickh     Initial support for building profiled libraries in
                        addition to debugging and optimized versions.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.98
2001-12-10 patrickh     Fixed a major bug in DPP_VERSION_COMPARE that prevented
                        it from ever working correctly.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.4.97
2001-12-06 patrickh     Changed the search order for the macro DPP_PATH_JAVA.
                        The new order gives preference to the
                        command-line-specified path which makes sense.
2001-11-18 patrickh     Added -DPIC to the C and C++ compiler's dynamic library
                        command-line arguments.
2001-11-15 patrickh     Added recognition of a new variable to dpp.install.mk
                        that allows users to list subdirectories for recursion
                        where only installation will occur.
2001-11-13 patrickh     Version number changed to 1.4.95 after the addition of
                        DPP_JDK_VERSION.
2001-11-10 patrickh     Generalized the IDL support.
2001-10-12 patrickh     Increased version to 1.4.94 after successful testing
                        with Autoconf 2.52 and Automake 1.5.  ace.m4 and
                        nspr.m4 had circular dependencies that Autoconf 2.5x
                        does not allow.
2001-09-06 patrickh     The targets for building shared libraries (DLLs) have
                        been renamed to avoid confusion.

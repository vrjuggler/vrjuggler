# Compiler flags needed for this application.  They are used as follows:
#
#    DEBUG_APP         - If set to TRUE, this application will be compiled with
#                        debugging symbols and no optimized symbols
#    OPTIM_APP         - If set to TRUE, this application will be compiled with
#                        optimized symbols and no debugging symbols
#    DEBUG_FLAGS       - Debugging flags passed to the compiler.  Settings this
#                        completely overrides what Doozer uses internally.
#    OPTIM_FLAGS       - Optimization flags passed to the compiler.  Settings
#                        this completely overrides what Doozer uses internally.
#    VJ_FULL_LIB_PATH  - Tell Doozer to use the full path to the Juggler
#                        library directory instead of just using the base lib
#                        directory.
#    VJ_LIB_TYPE       - Specify the type of VR Juggler library used for
#                        linking.  The possibilities are debug or opt.
#    EXTRA_CFLAGS      - Extra application-specific C compiler flags
#    EXTRA_CXXFLAGS    - Extra application-specific C++ compiler flags

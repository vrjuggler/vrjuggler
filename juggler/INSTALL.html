    Project. This is the code that will become VR Juggler 2.0, and it is the
    code that is used to create the VR juggler 2.0 pre-releases. Please be
    aware that this code represents a work in progress, and if you acquired it
    directly from CVS rather than using a pre-packaged source code snapshot,
    the code may have bugs affecting compilation and execution.</p><p>This document explains how to build the modules of the Juggler
    Project from the source code. We begin by explaining some issues related
    to specific operating systems. We then explain how to get the source code
    from our CVS repository. (Those users who downloaded a pre-packaged source
    release can skip ahead to <a href="#using.configure.pl" title="Using configure.pl">the section called &#8220;Using configure.pl&#8221;</a>). We
    conclude with instructions on how to build VR Juggler and its individual
    components.</p><p>Before reading further, we recommend that readers take a look at the
    Wiki page relating to building from CVS (<a href="http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/BuildingFromCvs" target="_top">http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/BuildingFromCvs</a>).
    It is a <span class="emphasis"><em>supplement</em></span> to this document containing tips
    and reminders for those users building the CVS version of VR Juggler. It
    is not a replacement for this document, nor can it stand on its own as
    build instructions. You are reading the definitive build instructions; the
    Wiki page merely provides informal, extra information.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e32"></a>Important Notes for IRIX Users</h3></div></div><div></div></div><p>Despite our best efforts, there are some issues related to
      compiling the Juggler Project on IRIX. We introduce them in this section
      and explain how to work around them.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e37"></a>Perl Version</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>There are many Perl scripts used as part of getting,
        configuring, and building the Juggler Suite of tools. In particular,
        two scripts required for compiling need Perl 5.005 or newer. The
        version of Perl that ships with IRIX 6.5 is very old (circa 1997) and
        does not work with many Perl scripts we have written. SGI provides a
        much newer version of Perl (5.6.1) with their freeware tools (<a href="http://freeware.sgi.com/" target="_top">http://freeware.sgi.com/</a>). It
        will be necessary to install that version for our scripts to work.
        This version is typically installed as <tt class="filename">/usr/freeware/bin/perl</tt>.</p><p>Once you have a modern Perl installed, you can run various Perl
        scripts as follows:</p><pre class="screen">/usr/freeware/bin/perl &lt;script-name&gt;</pre><p>The above will be required any time a Perl script fails with an
        error similar to the following:</p><pre class="screen">Perl 5.005 required--this is only version 5.00404, stopped at ./configure.pl line 35.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at ./configure.pl line 35.</pre><p>Furthermore, it is highly recommended that the <tt class="option">--with-perl</tt>
        argument be passed to <span><b class="command">configure.pl</b></span>. This argument
        gives all the Autoconf-based configure scripts a hint about where the
        preferred version of Perl lives. If using <tt class="filename">/usr/freeware/bin/perl</tt>
        to run <span><b class="command">configure.pl</b></span>, we recommend that the
        <span><b class="command">configure.pl</b></span> command line appear similar to the
        following:</p><pre class="screen">/usr/freeware/bin/perl configure.pl --with-perl=/usr/freeware/bin</pre><p>Note that the value given to <tt class="option">--with-perl</tt> is the
        <span class="emphasis"><em>directory</em></span> where the <span><b class="command">perl</b></span>
        executable can be found. The configure scripts will add this directory
        to the front of the search path when trying to find a suitable
        <span><b class="command">perl</b></span> executable. Once it is found, all the Perl
        scripts used for configuration, compilation, and installation will use
        that executable.</p><p>To simplify command execution somewhat, it can help to have
        <tt class="filename">/usr/freeware/bin</tt> (or whatever path is
        appropriate) in your path before <tt class="filename">/bin</tt> or
        <tt class="filename">/usr/bin</tt> or any of the other myriad directories
        where Perl might exist on IRIX. In such a situation, none of the above
        extra steps should be necessary. The correct version of Perl will be
        found simply by virtue of it being early in your path.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e100"></a>MIPSpro Compiler Version</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>Reports have been made on the VR Juggler mailing list regarding
        compile failures (including segmentation faults within the compiler)
        occur when using the MIPSpro Compilers Version 7.3.1.1m. We have found
        upgrading to Version 7.3.1.3m (or newer) fixes the problems.</p><p>A new feature of VR Juggler 1.1 is support for GCC on IRIX.
        Users who do not have MIPSpro or cannot upgrade can compile and run VR
        Juggler (without OpenGL Performer support) using the version of GCC
        distributed by SGI. It can be downloaded from <a href="http://freeware.sgi.com/index-by-alpha.html" target="_top">http://freeware.sgi.com/index-by-alpha.html</a>

Some components of the
      system will not compile with MS Visual Studio 6.0, and as a result, we
      currently require the use of Visual Studio 7 (.NET) to compile the
      source code. We understand that this is an inconvenience, and we are
      interested in methods for compiling the code with Visual Studio 6.
      However, due to VC6's poor support for templates and the C++
      standard in general, users need to be aware that it may not be possible.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="source.code.section"></a>Getting the Source Code and the Dependencies</h2></div></div><div></div></div><p>In this section, we explain how to get the Juggler Project source
    code and the dependencies required to build Juggler. There are two ways to
    get the source code: from a pre-packaged source release archive or from
    the CVS repository on SourceForge. If you got the code from a pre-packaged
    source archive, that code is a complete &#8220;<span class="quote">snapshot</span>&#8221; of the CVS
    repository at the time of release. It contains all dependencies that would
    otherwise have been acquired using CVS. It <span class="emphasis"><em>does not</em></span>
    contain binary dependencies that must be downloaded separately (such as
    NSPR, the Java Developer Kit, a C++ compiler, etc.).</p><p>The current list of <span class="emphasis"><em>required</em></span> software packages
    is as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CppDOM (<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/xml-cppdom/" target="_top">http://www.sf.net/projects/xml-cppdom/</a>):
        A lightweight, easy-to-use XML parser written in C++. CppDOM must be
        compiled and installed for use with VR Juggler.</p></li><li><p>Boost (<a href="http://www.boost.org/" target="_top">http://www.boost.org/</a>):
        A C++ library providing many powerful utility classes and libraries.
        Boost must be compiled and installed for use with VR Juggler.</p></li><li><p>GMTL (<a href="http://ggt.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://ggt.sf.net/</a>):
        A generic math library that makes use of C++ templates and STL
        paradigms. GMTL must be installed for use with VR Juggler.</p></li></ul></div><p>The following lists <span class="emphasis"><em>semi-optional</em></span> packages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>NSPR (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/" target="_top">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/nspr/</a>):
        The Netscape Portable Runtime, which can be used by VPR for threading
        and sockets (required on Win32, Solaris, and Mac OS X).</p></li><li><p>Java Developer Kit (<a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/</a>):
        The J2SE SDK (or JDK) is used to compile all the Java code used in the
        Juggler Project. Without it, none of the Java code can be built. We
        require version 1.3 or newer; we recommend version 1.4 or newer. The
        Java Standard Edition (J2SE) can be downloaded from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>.</p></li><li><p>OpenORB (<a href="http://www.jdom.org/" target="_top">http://openorb.sourceforge.net/</a>):

        A C++ implementation of CORBA 2.3, required for the Tweek C++ API.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the following subsections, we describe how to get all of the
    above except Boost, CppDOM, the JDK, OpenORB, omniORB, and NSPR. These
    must be downloaded separately from the sites listed above. You may also
    have to compile one or more of the packages if binary distributions are
    not available. Which packages you download depends on what you already
    have installed. Note carefully which packages are needed based on the
    software you have installed and what versions of tools (such as the JDK)
    that you download.</p><p>This remainder of this section is <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> for
    those users who want to get the Juggler Project source code from the CVS

        Java is used exclusively for GUIs such as Tweek and VRJConfig (which
        is a JavaBean that is loaded into Tweek). To compile the Java code, a
        JDK is necessary. We currently require version 1.3 or newer; we
        recommend version 1.4 or newer. The Java Standard Edition can be
        downloaded from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/" target="_top">http://java.sun.com/j2se/</a>.

It is
        required in order to compile the Tweek Java API (and hence VRJConfig)
        if you are using a version of the JDK older than 1.4.0. OpenORB 1.3.0
        can be downloaded from <a href="http://openorb.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://openorb.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p><p>There are three JAR files needed to use OpenORB 1.3 with Juggler

        <tt class="filename">avalon-framework.jar</tt>, and <tt class="filename">logkit.jar</tt>.
        All three come with a standard OpenORB distribution. We will show how
        to tell the configure scripts about these JAR files later.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e290"></a>omniORB</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>omniORB is a C++ implementation of CORBA 2.3. It is required in
        order to compile the Tweek C++ API. At this time, the Tweek C++ API is
        not required for VR Juggler, but this situation will change in the
        near future. At this time, we primarily use omniORB 4.0.x. omniORB can
        be downloaded from <a href="http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p><p>omniORB 3.0 has strange conventions for how installations are
        made. Within the <tt class="filename">bin</tt> and <tt class="filename">lib</tt>
        directories, there are platform-specific subdirectories that contain
        the actual binaries (except when installed on FreeBSD via the Ports
        Collection). Because of this, several extra options must be specified
        in order to tell the Tweek configure script where to find everything.

          an interesting special case. Sonix can make use of Aaudiere, OpenAL,
          or AudioWorks to add sound to VR Juggler applications. If none of
          those packages is found, Sonix will &#8220;<span class="quote">stub out</span>&#8221; its
          sound APIs. This means that Sonix and the VR Juggler Sound Manager
          can still be used in applications, but no audio will be heard at run
          time. See <a href="#sonix.compile.section" title="Sonix">the section called &#8220;Sonix&#8221;</a> for more

2. Compiling VR Juggler
==============================================================================

    A. Steps

          i. Choose a directory to put the VR Juggler source code
             (referred to as <JUGGLER_DIR> from now on).

         ii. Go to that directory and checkout VR Juggler using CVS
             NOTE: make sure CVS is set up, and pointing to the VR Juggler
             repository.  For more information about this, see the
             following page:

    http://www.vrjuggler.org/html/juggler.team.guide/build/get.source.html

            The simple version is:

                cd <JUGGLER_DIR>
                cvs checkout juggler

        iii. Enter the newly checked out Juggler source directory

                cd <JUGGLER_DIR>/juggler

         iv. Compile VR Juggler (using the Autoconf system and GNU make)

              a. Generate aclocal.m4, header template (vjDefines.h.in), and
                 the configure script

                    ./autogen.sh
    
              b. Probe the system for capabilities, generate Makefiles, etc.
                 (this configures the source tree for the current system)

                    ./configure

              c. Make the distribution using GNU make.  This compiles, links,
                 and creates the final distribution tree (in the form of
                 symlinks)

                    gmake

          v. Set the environment variable $VJ_BASE_DIR.  This is *required*
             by VR Juggler's application makefiles and runtime environment.

             NOTES:
                 1. The directory "instlinks" is semi-important. 
                    It is a working distribution of the VR Juggler library.
                    After "gmake" is done, you'll be able to use this
                    directory to compile and link your application code.
                    This will not work on Win32, so a full installation
                    must be performed.
                 2. It is helpful to have something similar to the following
                    line your $HOME/.tcshrc or $HOME/.cshrc file (assuming
                    the use of tcsh for your shell):

                        setenv VJ_BASE_DIR [JUGGLER_DIR]/juggler/instlinks

                    Use whatever is appropriate for your shell (BASH, ksh,
                    DOS, etc.)

    B. Advanced topics

       Sending compiler output to a different directory than the source
       tree can be helpful for debugging and development.  This is done
       by making a directory to put the object files and compiled
       libraries before building.

       The following steps set up a build directory within your VR Juggler
       source directory.  Here, we use the name <BUILD_DIR> to refer to
       the directory that will contain the object files and libraries.  It
       can be called whatever you want.

           mkdir <JUGGLER_DIR>/juggler/<BUILD_DIR>
           cd <JUGGLER_DIR>/juggler/<BUILD_DIR>
           <JUGGLER_DIR>/juggler/configure

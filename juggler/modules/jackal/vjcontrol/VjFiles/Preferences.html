VjControl preferences</h1>

Vjcontrol has a number of user-configurable options.  On startup,
it will attempt to load these preferences from the file
<tt>~/.vjconfig/vjcontrol.cfg</tt>.  If that file does not exist,
vjcontrol falls back to its hardcoded defaults.

<p>
The preferences can be
accessed from "Preferences" in the Options menu.  "Edit Preferences"
brings up a window to (surprise) edit the preferences.  This is the
same as the usual window used for editing ConfigChunks.

<p>
The "Save Preferences" option saves the current preferences to
 <tt>~/.vjconfig/vjcontrol.cfg</tt>, where they will be loaded
from the next time vjcontrol starts. 

<p>
<h2>VjControl preference options</h2>

<ul>

<h3><li>Look and Feel</h3>
This option lets the user change the overall look and feel (L&F) 
of the GUI, using the Java Swing classes.  The possible options 
are: Java (the default, also called "Metal"), Motif, Windows, 
and Macintosh. Note that the Windows and Mac L&Fs are only 
available when running on their respective platforms.  Vjcontrol 
will revert to Java/Metal if the requested L&F is unavailable.
<p>
Most of the differences between L&Fs are cosmetic, but you may 
wish to experiment.  The Windows L&F performs slightly better 
than Java/Metal under W98/NT.  The Java/Metal L&F has been most 
extensively tested.
<p>

<h3><li>Default Host and Default Port</h3>
These options are the default host name and port number that 
will appear in the Connections panel.  See
<a href="DynamicReconfiguration.html">Dynamic Reconfiguration</a> 
for more information.
<p>

<h3><li>Preload ChunkDesc Files</h3>
Here you can specify one or more Chunk Description files that 
will be loaded automatically when vjcontrol starts up.  The 
arguments are simply pathnames to files.  If the strings 
"$VJ_BASE_DIR" or "$HOME" are included in a path name, they will 
be replaced with the value of the $VJ_BASE_DIR environment 
variable or the user's home directory, respectively.
<p>
It is suggested that you include 
<tt>VJ_BASE_DIR/share/Data/chunksDesc</tt>, the main Chunk Description 
file.
<p>
You can override the automatic loading of files at startup by 
using the -noautoload <a href="cmdline.html">command-line 
argument</a>.
<p>

<h3><li>Preload Configuration Files</h3>
This lets you specify one or more Configuration files to load at 
startup (The details are similar to the option above).
<p>

<h3><li>Default ConfigChunk Files</h3>
This lets you specify one or more Configuration files which 
contain default values for new ConfigChunks.
When you create a new ConfigChunk in VjControl, it checks the default files 
for a Chunk of that type.  If found, it copies that value into the new Chunk.
<p>

<h3><li>Font Name and Font Size</h3>
This specifies the name and size of
font to use for all of vjcontrol's windows.  Note that currently only a 
small number of fonts are available (this is a limitation of JDK 1.1,
and will be fixed at a later date).

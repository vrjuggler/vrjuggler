2002-08-17 patrickh    If the IRIX SPROC threading subsystem is used with VPR,
                       the C++ ABI is disabled because SPROC threads conflict

2002-08-13 patrickh    Added the Kunststoff look and feel to the collection of
                       installed code.
2002-08-11 patrickh    Changed the URL for the beanlist XML Schema to include
                       version information:

                       standard installation targets.
2002-08-02 patrickh    Refactored the tweek::SubjectManager interface and the

                       open file with a different name (a "Save As ..."-type
                       option).
                       NEW VERSION: 0.6.1
2002-07-14 patrickh    org.vrjuggler.tweek.gui.MessagePanel is no longer a
                       singleton.  Further, it now uses a custom document,
                       org.vrjuggler.tweek.text.MessageDocument, an
                       instance of which is held by the TweekCore singleton.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.6.0

                       guarantee automatic uniqueness without using a special
                       naming context.  The tweek::SubjectManager interface 
                       has been extended to provide clients with additional
                       instance-specific information about a given reference.
                       NEW VERSION: 0.5.0

                       omniORB 3 are still the default implementations, but it
                       is easier to use different ORBs.
2002-02-12 patrickh    The Icon Viewer now uses buttons instead of labels for
                       its icons.  This makes it much more clear when a mouse
                       click is actually being processed.

                       registered with a tweek::SubjectManager.
2001-11-18 patrickh    Changed the use of tweek::SubjectManagerImpl so that
                       there is one associated with each tweek::CorbaManager
                       instance rather than one per memory space.
2001-11-13 patrickh    Encourage the use of OpenORB over JDK 1.4 so that this
                       software can be used with JDK 1.2 and 1.3.

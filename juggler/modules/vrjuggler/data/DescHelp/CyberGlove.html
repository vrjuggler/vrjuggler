    <TD>
      Chunk token: ``<TT>CyberGlove</TT>''<BR>
      Provides configuration information for a CyberGlove device.  Both
      hardware and software configuration can be done with this chunk.  On
      the hardware side, the serial port to which the glove is connected and
      the baud rate at which data is sampled can be set.  For the software
      configuration, the directory containing calibration data and the VR
      Juggler position proxy can be set.

    <TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
      <B>Port</B>
    </TD>
    <TD>
      Property token: ``<TT>port</TT>''<BR>
      Sets the serial port to which the glove is connected.  This is named
      by a string corresponding to the UNIX device node for the serial port
      on a UNIX system.

    <TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
      <B>Baud Rate</B>
    </TD>
    <TD>
      Property token: ``<TT>baud</TT>''<BR>
      Sets the sampling rate for the serial port to which the CyberGlove is
      connected.  This is an integer value that must be valid for the serial
      port and the glove.
    </TD>

    <TD ALIGN="RIGHT">
      <B>Calibration Directory</B>
    </TD>
    <TD>
      Property token: ``<TT>calDir</TT>''<BR>
      Names the directory where calibration data for the CyberGlove can be
      found.  This is a sting value, and as the name of a file, it depends
      upon the underlying filesystem for its syntax.  On UNIX, file names
      are case sensitive, and directories are separated by the `<TT>/</TT>'
      character.  On Win32-based systems, file names are <I>not</I> case
      sensitive, and directories are separated by the `<TT>\</TT>' character.

      <B>Glove Position</B>
    </TD>
    <TD>
      Property token: ``<TT>glovePos</TT>''<BR>
      Sets a position proxy for the CyberGlove position.  This should point
      to the tracker that is on the glove.  The proxy points to another chunk
      that must be in a predefined set of chunks.  The current allowed chunk
      types are the following:

      <UL>
	<LI>proxyAlias
	<LI>PosProxy
      </UL>

      Thus, the position proxy can point directly to a PosProxy chunk or to an
      alias for a PosProxy chunk.  New types can be added (or changed) in the
      chunk description file (<TT>chunksDesc</TT>).

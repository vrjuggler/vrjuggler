	<ul>
	<li>VjControl is perfect.  It has no bugs.  If in doubt, repeat this as a 
	mantra until you believe.

	<br><li>File names of loaded chunkorgtrees are not stored correctly,
	resulting in weird defaults for the org tree save file requester.

	<br><li>When dynamically reconfiguring a Juggler app, do not remove the 
	EM Connect ConfigChunk representing the connection between vjcontrol and
	the app.  This will cause the app to freeze (vjConnect suicide bug).
	Instead, use the <TT>Disconnect</TT> button in the Connections panel.

	<br><li>vjcontrol doesn't warn you if you modify a file and then close it
	without saving.

	<br><li>Changes made by editing description files (adding, removing, or editing
	ChunkDescs) in the Description pane are ignored by the Configure pane.
	If you modify a descriptions file in any significant way, you should save,
	quit VjControl, and then restart to modify the chunks.

	<br><li>Default chunk files are only loaded at vjcontrol startup.  If you edit
	the chunk files or change the file names in preferences, these won't take effect
	until you restart vjcontrol.

	<br><li>Strings can't contain quotes (parsing bug).

	<br><li>The current jdk1.2 release for Irix has some annoying minor glitches
	with window placement & sizing.

	<br><li>Double-clicking on chunk names in the org tree panel can occasionally 
	cause a null pointer exception.  This appears to be a bug in JFC 1.1 mouse
	click handling, and can safely be ignored.

	<br><li>The help panel (ie the window you're looking at now) doesn't respond to
	the font selected in preferences.

	<br><li>Additional frames that are open when vjcontrol's look & feel are 
	changed don't adopt the new look and feel. (The help panel never changes look & feel).

	<br><li>Run-time performance monitoring with multiple graphing windows open
	can be quite CPU-intensive (Java-too-slow error).

	<br><li>The "Print" option in the Performance panel actually just writes a
	summary to the standard output stream.

	<br><li>The Performance Graph windows occasionally display garbage when
	first opened.  Close & reopen to correct.

	</ul>

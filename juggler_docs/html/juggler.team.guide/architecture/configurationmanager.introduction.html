<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A full-fledged VR setup has a great deal of configuration information
&#150; display device names, video modes, window locations, tracker serial port settings
and calibration file names, application-specific data, and much else besides. The <i>Configuration
Manager</i> is an extensible database designed to organize all of that information.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The largest unit of configuration information in VR Juggler is the
&quot;chunk.&quot; A chunk contains all the configuration information for a particular
part of the VR system. For example, the chunk for a particular kind of tracker might
include information about serial port settings, position and orientation offsets, and the
location of a calibration file.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chunks are divided into properties. Each property has a type and one or
more values. Continuing the previous example, the tracker might have a &quot;serial
port&quot; property which contains a single string value. In a Unix system, the value
might be something like &quot;/dev/ttyd45&quot;. The positional offset might be a property
with three floating-point values, for the offsets along the x, y, and z axes.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Applications can use the Configuration Manager to define and store
their own configuration information. The different kinds of chunks are defined in a plain
text file; new chunk types can be defined by editing that file or using a convenient GUI
utility. The application&#146;s configuration data will be loaded with the rest of
Juggler&#146;s configuration information, and the application can query the Configuration
Manager for the data. Juggler&#146;s GUIs are entirely able to support user-defined
chunks, giving applications access to the same sort of simple, graphical configuration
tools as the VR Juggler environment itself, and also giving the application direct access
to Juggler&#146;s powerful dynamic reconfiguration capabilities.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are multiple Draw Managers. Each one encapsulates a specific
graphics Application Programming Interface (API). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The kernel instantiates the correct Draw Manager for the current
application, based on which graphics API the application is written for. The Draw Manager
handles various details of the graphics operations. It sets up viewing parameters for each
frame drawn, calls drawing functions defined by the application, and handles the details
of stereo viewing, buffer swapping, and so on. The Draw Manager can be configured to set
up viewing parameters for a variety of different display systems, from CAVEs to HMDs (the
distinctions of which are generally hidden from the application developer).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Draw Manager also manages whatever API-specific windowing and
graphic system initialization are required. For example, the Draw Manager is responsible
for the GLX library calls that are required to initialize OpenGL using the X Window
System.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">VR Juggler can be extended to support additional graphics APIs by
creating new Draw Managers (and creating new application framework classes to interface
with them). The rest of the library adapts seamlessly. </P>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every input device in the system, including trackers, joysticks, mice,
and keyboards, is controlled by the <i>Input Manager.</i> Input devices are divided into
several broad categories. Tracking systems are represented by Position devices, which
provide one or more sets of position and orientation data. There are also Analog devices
(Immersion box inputs) and Digital devices (like the buttons on a joystick or mouse). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A layer of abstraction is maintained between the application and the
actual device processes. When an application requests access to a particular device (e.g.
&quot;Give me the position input for the user&#146;s head tracking&quot;), what it
actually receives is a <i>proxy</i>. The application talks to the proxy, and the proxy
responds with the most recent data from the device. The concept is similar to a UNIX file
handle, which could refer to a local file or a network socket without the application
being aware of the underlying complexities. Proxies are one of the mechanisms that allow
running applications to be reconfigured without any disruption. The device hidden by an
input proxy can be stopped, restarted, or replaced with another of the same basic type.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also simulators for each of the major types of input devices.
For example, we can simulate a missing tracker with a keyboard-based simulator. Simulated
input can also be used to test applications during development. The application never has
to know what physical device is providing input.</p>

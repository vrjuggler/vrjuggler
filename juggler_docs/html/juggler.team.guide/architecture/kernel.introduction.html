<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Kernel binds all of VR Juggler&#146;s components together. It
controls the whole of the run-time system, and brokers all communications between the
various Managers. It also contains the main thread of control for the entire system. The
kernel keeps the entire system synchronized.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major advantage of this design is that the Managers are, for the most
part, loosely-coupled and very independent. This has proven to be a great aid in the
development process, because most modifications and additions to the system have been very
localized. This makes adding features, such as a Draw Manager for a new graphics API,
easier to write, easier to keep track of, and, most importantly, easier to debug.</P>

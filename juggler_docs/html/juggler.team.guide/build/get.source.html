<H3>Introduction</H3>

  <P>
    There are two ways to get the VR Juggler source code:
  </P>

  <OL>
    <LI>
      Get the source directly from the CVS repository.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      Download a snapshot of the source code as a tar file from the
      ``Download'' page.
    </LI>
  </OL>

  <P>
    Both methods are described in this section, though the second is
    mostly self-explanatory.
  </P>

<H3>Getting the Source Code from the CVS Repository</H3>

  <P>
    Before you can use CVS to get the source code, you must be sure that
    CVS itself is set up properly on your system.  Depending on your
    platform, CVS may be available in several different forms.  The most
    common version is the original command-line interface.  If CVS is not
    available on your system, you can get the source from
    <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/" TARGET="_top">CVShome.org</A>.  This
    version is available for all platforms including Win32.  For graphical
    interfaces, you can choose from the following:
  </P>

  <UL>
    <LI>
      MacCVS/WinCVS--a freely available front-end for CVS available from
      <A HREF="http://www.wincvs.org/" TARGET="_top">WinCvs.org</A>
    </LI>
    <LI>
      jCVS--a CVS client written in Java available from
      <A HREF="http://www.jcvs.org/" TARGET="_top">jCVS.org</A>
    </LI>
    <LI>
      tkCVS--a Tcl/Tk-based interface to CVS available from
      <A HREF="http://www.twobarleycorns.net/tkcvs.html" TARGET="_top">Two
      BarleyCorns</A>
    </LI>
  </UL>

  <P>
    Once you have CVS running in some form, you are ready to download the
    source from the VR Juggler repository, hosted at
    <A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/" TARGET="_top">SourceForge</A>.
    The instructions given here are from the
    <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=8041" TARGET="_top">CVS
    section</A> VR Juggler project page and are subject to change if the
    SourceForge policies change.  Note that there are two sets of
    directions on that page: one for anonymous access and one for
    developers with commit access.  Each of those is discussed in the
    following subsections.

<H4>Anonymous CVS Access</H4>

  <P>
    Anonymous CVS access is for those who want the latest source code but
    do not have commit access.  This would include developers who are
    working on patches they wish to submit for addition to the source
    base.  As of this writing, the following are the basic instructions
    for anonymous CVS access:
  </P>

  <OL>
    <LI>
      ``Log in'' to the SourceForge CVS server.  This step only has to be
      done the first time you access the repository.  Afterwards, the login
      setting is saved in your <TT>$HOME/.cvspass</TT> file.

<PRE>
    % <B>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.vrjuggler.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vrjuggler login</B>
</PRE>
    </LI>
    <LI>
      Check out a copy of the current VR Juggler source tree:

<PRE>
    % <B>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.vrjuggler.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vrjuggler checkout juggler</B>
</PRE>

      If what you really want is the VR Juggler 1.0 release branch
      instead of the developmental main branch, use the following command:

<PRE>
    % <B>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.vrjuggler.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vrjuggler checkout -r RELENG_1_0 juggler_1.0</B>
</PRE>

      (The string <TT>RELENG_1_0</TT> is the name of the branch in the
      CVS repository containing the VR Juggler 1.0 release code.  "RELENG"
      means "release engineering".)
    </LI>
  </OL>

  <P>
    Once you have the source checked out, you can use CVS as you normally
    would keeping in mind that you have read-only access to the repository
    when using anonymous access.
  </P>

  <P>
    You may find it useful to retain the CVSROOT value rather than always
    giving the <TT>-d</TT> option on the command line.  Setting the
    <TT>$CVSROOT</TT> environment variable does just that.  Defining an
    alias such as <TT>cvsjuggler</TT> that sets the environment variable
    is the recommended method.
  </P>

<H4>Developers with Commit Access</H4>

  <P>
    For those developers with commit access, the steps are slightly
    different.  You <I>must</I> have some version of SSH1 installed to
    access the repository as a developer.  This is required by SourceForge,
    and we (the VR Juggler Team) have no control over this.  The steps
    then to get a read/write copy of the VR Juggler source tree are as
    follows:
  </P>

  <OL>
    <LI>
      Set the environment variable <TT>$CVS_RSH</TT> to use <TT>ssh</TT>(1).

<PRE>
    % <B>CVS_RSH = ssh</B>
</PRE>

      (Note that this is using the
      <A HREF="${GETTINGSTARTED}/environment.variables.html">shell-independent
      environment variable syntax</A> defined in the
      <I>Getting Started Guide</I>.)  It is recommended that you set this
      environment variable in your shell's configuration appropriate
      configuration file or as part of an alias that configures your
      environment to work with the VR Juggler CVS repository.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      Check out the source using your SourceForge login name.

<PRE>
    % <B>cvs -d<I>login_name</I>@cvs.vrjuggler.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vrjuggler checkout juggler</B>
</PRE>

      Be sure to use the appropriate branch name.
    </LI>
  </OL>

  <P>
    Note that there is no login step in this case.  Your SourceForge
    password is required for all CVS commands.  
  </P>

  <P>
    After this point, you can access the CVS repository as though it is a
    normal, local repository.  As with the anonymous CVS access, you can
    set the <TT>$CVSROOT</TT> environment variable to the value given with
    the <TT>-d</TT> option above.  For further information about using SSH
    with SourceForge, please refer to the appropriate SSH documentation
    and to
    <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=761&group_id=1" TARGET="_top">SourceForge's
    documentation</A>.
  </P>

<H3>Getting a Snapshot of the Source Code</H3>

  <P>
    As a developer, you will probably need access to the latest VR Juggler
    source and therefore should be getting it from the CVS repository.  In
    some cases, however, it may be helpful to get a snapshot of the code
    in an archived format.  The <A HREF="${DOWNLOAD}/index.html">download
    page</A> on the VR Juggler website has a
    <A HREF="${DOWNLOAD}/index.html#src">section listing source code
    snapshots</A>.  Here, you can get a compressed tar file containing
    the official source code for a particular release of VR Juggler.
    These snapshots are not for developmental purposes and will not give
    you access to the CVS repository.
  </P>

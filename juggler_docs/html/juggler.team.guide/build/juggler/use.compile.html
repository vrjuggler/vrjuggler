<A NAME="intro"><H4>Introduction</H4></A>

  <P>
    To improve portability and consistency across platforms, VR Juggler
    uses GNU make for building the library (installation is covered
    <A HREF="${TEAMGUIDE}/build/juggler/use.install.html">elsewhere</A>).
    The makefiles used employ many features that are unique to GNU make
    thus requiring that people who wish to compile Juggler from its source
    are required to have it installed.  The Juggler makefiles are known to
    to work with versions 3.76.1, 3.77.x and 3.78.1 of GNU make.  To make
    sense of this documentation, please understand the concepts listed in
    <A HREF="#required">Required Reading</A>.  Posting about these subjects
    to the mailing list will probably be ignored.
  </P>

  <P>
    As mentioned in the introduction, Juggler requires the use of GNU make
    for compiling.  This section provides a very short introduction to the
    use of make in general.  It is assumed that the GNU make command is
    ``gmake''.  To verify that the version of GNU available is one of the
    known working versions, do:

<PRE>
    % <B>gmake -v</B>
</PRE>

    It will return something similar to the following output:

<PRE>
    <B>GNU Make version 3.76.1</B>, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
    Copyright (C) 1988, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97

    There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

</PRE>

    The text in bold is the version information.  For best results, this
    should be one of the version numbers listed in the
    <A HREF="#intro">introduction</A>.
  </P>

  <P>
    Most, if not all, versions of make (not just GNU make) use the following
    syntax for execution:

<PRE>
    make [VARIABLE1=&lt;value1&gt;] [VARIABLE2=&lt;value2&gt;] [...] [target1] [target2] [...]
</PRE>

    The options in square brackets are not required.  The <TT>[...]</TT>
    strings mean that any number of the previous option can be given.  If
    executed with no arguments, the default target will be built.  This is
    either the first target defined in the corresponding makefile or one
    explicitly denoted as `<TT>default</TT>' in the makefile.  Typically,
    the default target is `<TT>all</TT>'.  Any target(s) can be built by
    simply naming them on the command line.
  </P>

  <P>
    Variables used in the makefile can be overridden by command-line
    arguments.  Simply name the variable (e.g., <TT>CC</TT>, the C compiler
    command) and give it a value (e.g., <TT>CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc</TT>).
    This forces all references to the variable in the makefile to use
    what is on the command line.
  </P>

  <P>
    Other useful options for GNU make are the following:

    <UL>
      <LI>
        <TT>-k</TT>: Keep going even when errors are encountered
      </LI>
      <LI>
        <TT>-f &lt;filename&gt;</TT>: Explicitly name the makefile to use
        instead of the default (either <TT>Makefile</TT> or
        <TT>makefile</TT> found in the current directory)
      </LI>
      <LI>
        <TT>-j</TT>: Do a parallel build of the target(s)
      </LI>
      <LI>
        <TT>-l &lt;float-value&gt;</TT>: Limit the load on the machine to
        the specified value when doing a parallel build
      </LI>
    </UL>
  </P>

<A NAME="targets"><H4>Targets</H4></A>

  <P>
    This section describes all the targets related to building VR Juggler
    from its source code.  The targets are grouped together depending upon
    how they are related.  For information on what is actually done as part
    of the compiling process, <A HREF="#steps">see below</A>.  A current
    list of all the targets (with descriptions) can be found at the top of
    <TT>Makefile.in</TT> in the top-level Juggler source directory.
  </P>

  <DL>
    <DT>`<TT>world</TT>'
      <DD>Clean up the build environment and then build and install
          everything using the default ABI and ISA.  This is a simple target
          for those who just want to build and install VR Juggler as simply
          as possible.  ``Everything'' in this case is the following:

          <UL>
            <LI>
              Debugging and optimized versions of the library binaries
            </LI>
            <LI>
              Shared and static versions of the library binaries (if both are
              supported on the target platform)
            </LI>
            <LI>
              Header files
            </LI>
            <LI>
              Sample applications, test code and user tools
            </LI>
            <LI>
              Data files (sample config files, model files, etc.)
            </LI>
            <LI>
              VjControl (if it was built)
            </LI>
          </UL>

    <DT>`<TT>world-all-abi</TT>'
      <DD>This is the same as the `<TT>world</TT>' target except that it
          builds and installs <I>all possible</I> ABI and ISA combinations
          for the target platform.  On IRIX, for example, this means that
          all combinations of N32, 64, mips3 and mips4 (debugging and
          optimized versions) are built and installed.  Most platforms
          currently support only one ABI/ISA combination thus making this
          target the same as `<TT>world</TT>'.
    <DT>`<TT>buildworld</TT>' (same as `<TT>all</TT>')
      <DD>Build everything.  This target is another name for the
          `<TT>all</TT>' target.  It executes the first phase of the
          `<TT>world</TT>' target (i.e., only the build phase, not the
          install phase).  Since it builds both debugging and optimized
          versions of VR Juggler without installing, it is useful for
          testing changes to the library code to ensure that it works in
          both the debugging and optimized cases.
    <DT>`<TT>all-abi</TT>'
      <DD>In the same manner as `<TT>world-all-abi</TT>', this target
          builds, but <I>does not install</I>, all possible ABI/ISA
          combinations for the target platform.  Thus, it provides
          functionality that could also be called
          `<TT>buildworld-all-abi</TT>', but the length of such a target's
          name is unwieldy.
    <DT>`<TT>debug</TT>' (default target)
      <DD>Build only the debugging version of the library binaries (both
          static and dynamic).  In other words, the libraries are built so
          that debugging symbols are turned on.  It is the combination of
          `<TT>dbg</TT>' and `<TT>ddso</TT>' (see below). <I>This is the
          default target and is what gets built if running <TT>make</TT>
          with no arguments.</I>
    <DT>`<TT>optim</TT>'
      <DD>Build only the optimized version of the library binaries (both
          static and dynamic).  This is built with <I>no</I> debugging
          symbols at all.  It is the combination of `<TT>opt</TT>' and
          `<TT>dso</TT>'.
    <DT>`<TT>dbg</TT>'
      <DD>Build only the <I>static</I> debugging version of the libraries.
          This does the same thing as `<TT>debug</TT>' but does not compile
          the dynamic libraries.
    <DT>`<TT>ddso</TT>'
      <DD>Build only the <I>dynamic</I> debugging version of the libraries.
          This does the same thing as `<TT>debug</TT>' but does not compile
          the static libraries.
    <DT>`<TT>opt</TT>'
      <DD>Build only the <I>static</I> optimized version of the libraries.
          This does the same thing as `<TT>optim</TT>' but does not compile
          the dynamic libraries.
    <DT>`<TT>dso</TT>'
      <DD>Build only the <I>dynamic</I> optimized version of the libraries.
          This does the same thing as `<TT>optim</TT>' but does not compile
          the static libraries.
    <DT>`<TT>gui</TT>'
      <DD>Compile the VjControl Java files and collect them into
          <TT>VjControl.jar</TT>.  This is only done if the configure
          script found a working Java compiler during its phase of the
          compile process.
    <DT>`<TT>links</TT>'
      <DD>Set up the developer pseudo-installation environment.  More
          detail is given on this subject <A HREF="#devel">below</A>.
    <DT>`<TT>clean</TT>'
      <DD>Clean up everything in the build environment.  This uses a
          `<TT>clean</TT>' target defined in <TT>Makefile.base</TT> that
          is automatically shared by all makefiles that include that file.
          The cleaning process is recursive just as the build process is.
          Each makefile defines which files are safe for cleaning, but
          generally core files, compiler-generated files and object files
          are the only things removed during this process.
    <DT>`<TT>cleandepend</TT>'
      <DD>Clean up the automatically generated dependency files (the
          <TT>.d</TT> files in each directory).  This method for cleaning
          up deletes only these files and nothing else--ever.
    <DT>`<TT>clean-links</TT>'
      <DD>Remove the developer pseudo-installation environment.  More detail
          is given on this subject <A HREF="#devel">below</A>.
    <DT>`<TT>clobber</TT>'
      <DD>Clean up (clobber) the entire build environment except what was
          generated by <TT>configure</TT>.  This runs the previous clean-up
          targets and removes the object directory(ies) and <TT>lib</TT>
          directory(ies).  Its purpose is to totally reset the build
          environment to its state just prior to running
          <TT>configure</TT>.
    <DT>`<TT>info</TT>'
      <DD>Print out all the targets with short descriptions as well as
          default values for some variables that may be overridden by the
          user.  For more information about variables in the Juggler
          makefiles, <A HREF="#variables">see below</A>.
  </DL>

<A NAME="variables"><H4>Useful Variables</H4></A>

  <P>
    As with all make-based build systems, variables used in the makefiles
    can be overridden by the user.  This section describes variables that
    developers may find useful to override while compiling.  The variables
    are listed alphabetically.
  </P>

  <DL>
    <DT><TT>prefix</TT>
      <DD>Provide an alternate installation prefix than what was set at
          configuration time.  Refer to the
          <A HREF="${TEAMGUIDE}/build/juggler/use.install.html">installation
          documentation</A> for more information about installing Juggler.
    <DT><TT>vjABI</TT>
      <DD>Define an alternate ABI/ISA combination than the default set by
          <TT>configure</TT>.  This accepts exactly the same values as the
          <TT>--with-abi</TT> argument to the configure script.  Results of
          its use can be seen near the bottom of <TT>Makefile.base</TT>.
    <DT><TT>NO_CLEAN</TT>
      <DD>Do not clobber the build environment (via the `<TT>clobber</TT>'
          target) before running the `<TT>world</TT>' target.  Set this
          variable to <TT>1</TT> to enable it.
    <DT><TT>NO_JAVA_GUI</TT>
      <DD>Disable compiling and installing of VjControl by setting this
          variable to <TT>1</TT> when building.  This is very handy when
          VjControl is not building properly or is not needed for whatever
          reason.
    <DT><TT>OBJDIR</TT>
      <DD>Set an alternate directory in which object files are created.
          The default method is to use the platform- and ABI-specific
          directory when compiling from the top-level directory or to use
          the current directory when compiling in a subdirectory.
    <DT><TT>OBJ_FILE_SUFFIX</TT>
      <DD>Choose an alternate suffix for object files that are compiled.
          When compiling with MS Visual C++, ``<TT>obj</TT>'' is the default.
          In all other cases, ``<TT>o</TT>'' is the default.  Only specify
          the suffix, not the `<TT>.</TT>' as that is always present.
    <DT><TT>PERL</TT>
      <DD>Provide a different version of a Perl 5.004 or newer binary than
          what <TT>configure</TT> found.
  </DL>

<A NAME="options"><H4>GNU Make Options</H4></A>

  <P>
    Two options can be used with GNU make when compiling VR Juggler.  They
    provide the capability to build the library in parallel to take
    advantage of hardware that can do this effectively.  To enable parallel
    building, specify the <TT>-j</TT> argument on the command line.  With
    no argument, there is no limit to the number of jobs that are spawned
    by the build process.  An integer argument limits the number of jobs
    to that value.  (<I>NOTE: Thus far, we have not had any success in
    using this argument to limit the number of jobs and instead have had to
    limit the load on the machine.</I>)
  </P>

  <P>
    The second argument enforces load balancing on the machine while doing
    a parallel build.  To do this, use the <TT>-l</TT> option with a
    floating-point value as the load limit.  Note that to be allowed to do
    this, GNU make must be installed setgid on many platforms.  When used
    in combination with the <TT>-j</TT> option, parallel compiling can be
    done while not loading the machine down too heavily.
  </P>

<A NAME="steps"><H4>Process of Building (Individual Steps)</H4></A>

  <P>
    This section describes the steps taken by the `<TT>world</TT>' target
    as it <I>builds</I> Juggler.  All other build targets are subsets of
    `<TT>world</TT>', and this information can be applied accordingly.
    The steps are:
    
    <OL>
      <LI>
        Clobber the build environment so that it is as it would be after
        running <TT>configure</TT> in a clean directory tree.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Build the object files for the optimized version of the library
        binaries.  Part of this process is to generate dependencies for
        each <TT>.c</TT> and <TT>.cpp</TT> file on the fly.  These
        dependencies are listed in corresponding <TT>.d</TT> files and are
        updated automatically whenever a change in a source or header file
        is detected.  All targets, except `<TT>cleandepend</TT>', run in
        the subdirectories of the source tree (not just the one that builds
        optimized object files) ensure that dependencies are up to date all
        the time.  Compiling from the top-level directory of the build
        environment puts the optimized object files in a platform- and
        ABI-specific subdirectory named as
        <TT>obj/&lt;platform&gt;/&lt;ABI&gt;/&lt;ISA&gt;/opt</TT>.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Create the static and dynamic versions of the library binaries from
        the optimized object files.  The binaries are built in the
        subdirectory named as <TT>lib/&lt;ISA&gt;/opt</TT> and are linked to
        from the <TT>lib</TT> directory.  Note that <TT>lib</TT> may be
        named differently on some platforms.  On IRIX, for example, depending
        on the default ABI, it may be named <TT>lib32</TT> or
        <TT>lib64</TT>.  It is referred to as ``<TT>lib</TT>'' for
        simplicity.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Repeat steps 2 and 3 for the debugging version of the object files
        and library binaries.
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Once all libraries are built, links are set up in the <TT>lib</TT>
        directory and its ISA subdirectory (if there is one) that point to
        the default library version.  This is currently the debugging
        version since that is what developers are likely to use most
        frequently.  These links overwrite those made in step 3 (and
        repeated in step 4).
      </LI>
      <LI>
        Compile VjControl if the Java compiler is available and compiling
        of it has not been disabled by the user (<A HREF="#variables">see
        above</A> for more information).
      </LI>
    </OL>

    The remainder of the work done is installation.  More information
    on installing is available in the
    <A HREF="${TEAMGUIDE}/build/juggler/use.install.html">installation
    documentation</A>.
  </P>

<A NAME="devel"><H4>Developer ``Installation''</H4></A>

  <P>
    To facilitate development of VR Juggler applications, an environment
    is created after compiling that simulates a fully installed version of
    the library and its components.  This is done entirely within the build
    environment and is rooted in a directory called <TT>instlinks</TT> (a
    subdirectory of the top-level build directory).
  </P>

  <P>
    When the build process completes, a message is printed telling the
    developer the value to which s/he should set the environment variable
    <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR</TT>.  By doing this simple step, the developer is
    given a pseudo-installation where Juggler applications (that are part
    of the source tree) can be compiled and executed.  These applications
    are linked statically on IRIX, but on all other UNIX-based platforms,
    they are linked dynamically.  In those cases, <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT>
    should be set to the value ``<TT>$VJ_BASE_DIR/lib</TT>'' which is a
    normal step in the setup process for using an actual installation.
  </P>

  <P>
    As of this writing, this environment is not available on a Win32
    platform.  This is because the creation of it relies heavily on
    symbolic links.  Because of this, Juggler must be fully installed for
    application development.  Suggestions for enabling an equivalent
    development environment for Win32 are welcomed.  It is possible, after
    installing Juggler, to continue working within the build environment.
    Set <TT>VJ_BASE_DIR</TT> to the installation directory and continue
    working as on any other platform.  All library binaries and headers
    will be referenced from the installed version, but source code (for
    applications as an example) comes from the Juggler source tree.
  </P>

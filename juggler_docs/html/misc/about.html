VR Juggler</h2>

<p>
VR Juggler is a platform for virtual reality applications. The name comes
from the delicate balance that must be struck between flexibility,
performance, and ease-of-use.  You develop your application once for VR
Juggler, then anywhere that Juggler is supported, your application is also
supported.  </p>

<p>VR Juggler's design addresses several key requirements for a virtual reality
development system. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Performance</li>
  <li>Flexibility</li>
  <li>Rapid application development</li>
  <li>Ease of use</li>
  <li>Extensibility</li>
  <li>Portability</li>
</ul>

<br><br>

Flexibility is achieved by placing common abstractions over I/O
devices.  New devices can  be added easily, and existing devices
can be reconfigured or replaced, even while an application is running.<br><br>

To allow optimal performance, applications are given direct access to
graphics APIs (currently including OpenGL&#153 and Iris Performer&#153).<BR><BR>

VR Juggler includes built-in support for performance
monitoring of applications and graphics subsystems.  It
supports multiple-processor machines and will support distributing 
applications across multiple machines.<br><br>

Using VR Juggler and developing applications are kept as simple as
possible.  Small base classes provide a skeleton for application
development, while the abstractions of I/O devices simplify programming.
During run-time, any VR Juggler application can be controlled or 
reconfigured by a Java-based graphical interface.<br><br>

VR Juggler is designed to support a wide array of VR hardware on a 
variety of architectures.  Several tracking systems, gloves, and
input devices are already supported.  VR Juggler supports projection-
based displays such as the CAVE&#153 or C2, and includes support for 
head-mounted devices.  Development work is being done on <b>IRIX</b>,
<b>LiNUX</b>, <b>Windows NT</b>, <b>Solaris</b>&#153, <b>FreeBSD</b>,
and <b>HP/UX</b>&#153 systems.<br><br>

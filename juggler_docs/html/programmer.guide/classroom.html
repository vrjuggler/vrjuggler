<h3>
VRJuggler Workshop</h3>

<ol>
<h4>
Overview of Juggler and its capabilities</h4>

<ul>
<h5>
Purpose of Juggler:</h5>

<ul>
<li>
To allow you to create VR applications as easily as possible.</li>

<li>
To allow you to create an application that runs on many different displays
(C2, C6, head-mounted, 3d auditorium, etc.) and also allow you to create
and test it with the same tools.</li>

<li>
To allow you to hook up different interfaces, such as a wand or a glove,
without having to write the drivers yourself.&nbsp; You'll be able to change
configuration files with vjControl.</li>

<li>
To acheive optimal performance when running your VR application.</li>
</ul>

<h5>
Extras that will help you create VR applications.</h5>

<ul>
<li>
A simulator -- because no one person has access to an expensive CAVE 24
hours a day.</li>

<li>
You don't have to worry about setting up displays, double-buffering, etc.&nbsp;
All that is done for you with optimizations in mind.</li>

<li>
Helpful math libraries such as vector, matrix, and quaternion classes are
included, which you can use or include your own instead.</li>
</ul>

<h5>
<font size=-1>A simple application</font> that uses openGL and vrJuggler.</h5>
Look at the Case Studies: Wand Example and understand the following things.
<br>Note that knowledge of C++ classes and object oriented programming
is important.
<ul>
<li>
Application class&nbsp; (class wandApp : public vjGlApp)</li>

<br>&nbsp; Init -- initialize things like controls.
<br>&nbsp; Draw -- where all your draw commands will take place.
<br>Getting Wand Input -- how to get the wand's position and orientation.
<br>Main -- not much needs to be modified here.&nbsp; Mostly starts your
program.</ul>
</ul>

<h4>
Running a simple program in the simulator</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Compiling:</li>

<br>Problems compiling samples may be caused by incorrect variable and
path setup.
<li>
Simulating:</li>

<br>Enter the executable name followed by a list of configuration files.
<br>Example:&nbsp; program_name ~/.vjconfig sim.base.config ~/.vjconfig/sim.wand.mixin.config
<li>
Windows:</li>

<br>View, head, camera, and wand.
<li>
Controlling the wand, head, and camera.</li>

<br>Move the mouse over a window and use the buttons that are defined in
your sim config file.
<li>
The configuration in your config files can be changed with VJcontrol.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
vjControl</h4>
Has its own documentation section on this website.
<br>Additional requirements: set path to include $VJ_BASE_DIR/bin and setenv
JDK_HOME /usr/java)
<ul>
<h5>
<b><font size=-1>Purpose</font></b></h5>
to allow the same application to be set up for different input/output devices.&nbsp;
Allows it to change at run-time (without recompiling).
<h5>
<b><font size=-1>Run</font></b> vjControl</h5>
Type "vjcontrol".&nbsp; If there is an error make sure your paths and environment.
variables are set correctly.
<h5>
Predefined configuration files are available.</h5>
When starting to learn juggler it is not necessary to modify configuration
files.&nbsp; You will want to use vjControl after you have&nbsp; created
basic Juggler programs with the default configuration files.
<h5>
<b><font size=-1>Modify</font></b> a configuration file yourself:</h5>

<ul>
<li>
If you want to change something, try using existing config files as a starting
point.</li>

<li>
Simple vjControl operations: Remove, Copy, Insert.</li>

<li>
Try changing something simple:</li>

<li>
In sim.base.config:&nbsp; change the keys in Input|Simulated Devices|SimCamera1</li>

<br>Or try adding a fourth button to the wand in Input|Proxies and Aliases|DigitalProxy</ul>

<h5>
<b><font size=-1>Summary</font></b></h5>

<ul>
<li>
Not absolutely necessary for beginners, but you will want to learn how
to do it.</li>

<li>
If you don't like the current interfaces like the simulator, you can modify
some of it.&nbsp; If you are using custom peripherals you will have to
customize it.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>
More in depth look at how Juggler works</h4>

<ul>
<h4>
<b><font size=-1>Function</font></b> uses and descriptions</h4>
To find out more about each function, look in the Programmer Reference
Book on this website.
<h5>
<b>B<font size=-1>asic flow</font></b> of a vrJuggler progroam.</h5>
There are more functions (ContextPreDraw, PipePreDraw, etc.) but learn
the following first:
<p>init();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Init
before API is started
<br>api_init();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Init after API is started
<br>contextInit();&nbsp;&nbsp; // (OpenGL specific) Init, do things like
create display lists.
<br>while (drawing)&nbsp;&nbsp; // The Drawing Loop
<br>{
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; preFrame();
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; draw();
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; intraFrame();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
//&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing is happening while here
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// CAREFUL: don't modify data in intraFrame that is used in the draw function.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// if you want to do processing that data here, you must buffer it.s
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sync();
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; postFrame();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// Drawing is now done
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UpdateTrackers();
<br>}
<p>Note: Performer applications have some different functions, but the
idea is mostly the same.&nbsp; You can refer to the header files in Programmer
Reference for specific information.</ul>

<h4>
What to do on your own</h4>

<ol>
<h5>
Getting Started</h5>
Set your paths, and compile the sample program.
<br>Use the simulator
<h5>
Make changes</h5>
Change parts of the sample codes and see what happens.
<br>Simple example: in the cubes example, change acceleration or add some
shapes.
<br>More Complex: change what happens when you click, or change the navigation
so that it only rotates on the y-axis.s
<h5>
<font size=-1>Questions?</font></h5>
Look for help on the webpage: www.vrjuggler.org
<br>It contains setup information, header files,
<h5>
<b><font size=-1>Header files</font></b></h5>
are in $VJ_BASE_DIR/include define all the functions available to you.&nbsp;
They are also available on this website in Programmer Reference.
<h5>
<b><font size=-1>Use the internet</font></b> as a resource,</h5>
Examples of where it is helpful:
<ol>
<li>
Figuring out how graphics or geometry problems like intersection of a line
and a plane, etc.</li>

<li>
Understanding details of c++, such as class inheritance, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h5>
<font size=-1>Practice Exercise</font></h5>
Modify any of the example files to accomplish the following
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Place a cube, a sphere and a cone inside the area
where a user can walk in the virtual space.&nbsp; Using a wand, allow a
user to grab each object independently and to release it anywhere in that
space.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you are able to compile and simulate Jugger
programs, you should be able to do understand how to do this in a couple
days.&nbsp; It may take longer to implement since you will be learning
some of the classes and functions that you can use.s</ol>

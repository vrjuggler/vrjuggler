<h2><img border=0 src="${IMAGES}/Icons/24x24_Images/Battery.gif"> Developing Applications for Juggler</h2>

There are many things to learn about developing for Juggler, but there are a 
few key concepts that you need to keep in mind as you read the 
documentation:<BR><BR>

<h4>All documentation is Online!</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>
There are no books, or README files that you have to wade through. <BR>
Most new developers will use the "Programmer Guide" to get started, and to understand new concepts and conventions that Juggler uses.<BR>
When you begin writing code you will need to use the "Programmer Reference", which outlines everything in the juggler library.<BR>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Your application is a class object</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>All VR Juggler applications are user defined C++ classes.&nbsp; These classes are
  derived from abstract base classes defined by VR Juggler.&nbsp; The user defined
  applications extend the base classes by defining implementations of the base class virtual
  functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Different Application Base Class for each API</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are base application classes for each API.&nbsp; These classes provide the
  interface that Juggler needs for that specific API.&nbsp; There are also API specific
  extensions for some base classes to give users extra abilities or make programming for
  some specific feature of that API easier.</p>
  
  For <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a> - use vjGlApp<br>
  For IRIS Performer - use vjPfApp<BR>

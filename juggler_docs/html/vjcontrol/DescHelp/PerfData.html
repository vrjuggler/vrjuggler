      A chunk that describes to vjcontrol how to display performance data from
      a particular source.  Currently very simple, this chunk will be expanded
      as needed to provide control over visually presenting performance data.

      The name of the chunk is also the class of performance tests that it
      provides information about.  Examples in the Juggler beta are 
      ``<TT>Kernel</TT>'' and ``<TT>vjGlPipe</TT>''.

      Most of the Juggler performance tests divide a particular process,
      such as the main vjKernel loop, into multiple phases which measured
      individually.  The labels property lets you assign text labels to each
      phase.  For example, the labels for a simplified version of the Kernel
      loop would be:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Application PreDraw</li>
	    <li>Application Draw</li>
            <li>Swap Buffers</li>
            <li>Update Projections</li>
	  </ol>

                        NEW VERSION: 0.11.0
Apr-29-2003 patrickh    Extended gadget::EventWndow so that it can act as an
                        event source.  At this time, only the X11 windows are

                        the desired units when calling getData().
                        Also removed the old API that returned a reference to
                        the internal position data.
                        The interface of PositionData also changed to reflect
                        the design of not returning the internal matrix by a
                        pointer.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.7.0

Jan-09-2003 allenb      Removed delta value hack for remote input manager.
                        Also removed SerializableDevice interface.  We now just
                        use the SerializableObject interface.
Jan-08-2003 allenb      Updated to the new ObjectWriter & ObjectReader
                        interfaces.

                        NEW VERSION: 0.6.3
Oct-30-2002 allenb      Added a new interface to PosProxy for specifying what
                        units to return position data in.  This also completes
                        the change over to using positional filters and
                        converting gadgeteer to using meters as the common unit
                        for all internal positional data and all configuration
                        units.
Oct-30-2002 allenb      PositionXformFilter now supports pre and post
                        transforms.  This will allow it to be used for position
                        devices and for position proxies.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.6.3
Oct-29-2002 patrickh    The Input Manager can now scan a list of directories to
                        find driver DSOs.  Scanning is performed in addition to
                        the individual driver loading added in version 0.5.0.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.6.2
Oct-29-2002 allenb      Migrated Positional devices to use new PositionFilter
                        interface for all data transformations.  This removes
                        all transformation code from the devices drivers and
                        moves it into common code in gadget::Position.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.6.1
Oct-28-2002 allenb      All base device type interfaces now make the sample
                        buffers private data.  Derived devices add data and
                        swap the buffer using a new interface in the base
                        device type class.  This is a first step in adding the
                        filter code to the system.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.6.0
Oct-19-2002 patrickh    Use of the numeric keypad works on HP and Sun hardware.

                        with the sample buffers.  This fix was submitted by

                        the port name and baud rate of a device.  The
                        individual devices are responsible for that now.

                        the new JCCL config chunk API.  These changes have not
                        been tested with a real device yet.
Jul-05-2002 subatomic   KeyboardWin32 now works with grabbing input
                        focus when in a "locked" state. It supports the mouse
                        warp feature, and can capture kb/m when cursor is
                        not in the window.
                        This class has also been refactored so that
                        subclasses of it can create their own windows and
                        still get window event input.
Jun-24-2002 patrickh    The gadgeteer-config script is now written in Perl.  It
                        is capable of determining its installation path at

May-07-2002 patrickh    Changed the type of gadget::Input::mPort to be
                        std::string instead of char*.  Drivers that were
                        relying on this member have been updated, and code
                        with questionable memory safety has been fixed.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.1

Feb-24-2002 allenb      Added interface to Digital, Analog, and Position to
                        allow returning of current sample buffer.  This feature
                        had been overlooked in the original impl.
Feb-21-2002 allenb      Made SampleBuffers smarter in the way the swap.  Now
                        they do not swap unless there is new data.  Also
                        removed an assertion that was invalid and was thus
                        causing stability problems.
Feb-17-2002 eolson      Merged Remote Input Manager from developmental branch
                        to the HEAD branch.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.1.0
Jan-21-2002 allenb      Fixed various bugs associated with the SampleBuffer
                        conversion.
Jan-18-2002 allenb      Converted all input to use SampleBuffer to track
                        data history and allow for filtering.
Oct-23-2001 allenb      Converted InputManager to a singleton
Oct-23-2001 ALL         First successful compile of the new system

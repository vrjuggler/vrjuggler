Jul-12-2002 patrickh    jccl::ConfigChunkDB no longer derives from std::vector.
                        jccl::ChunkDescDB no longer derives from std::map.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.4.0
Jul-02-2002 nonchocoboy New ConfigChunkDB editor edits ConfigChunks through the
                        property sheet UI model.
Jun-24-2002 patrickh    The jccl-config script is now written in Perl.  It is
                        capable of determining its installation path at
                        runtime.
Jun-19-2002 nonchocoboy ChunkDescs now have category information.
Jun-16-2002 nonchocoboy NEW VERSION: 0.3.0
Jun-16-2002 nonchocoboy NEW VERSION: 0.2.2
Jun-11-2002 nonchocoboy VjControl now runs as a Tweek bean.
Jun-10-2002 nonchocoboy Ported generic editor panel creation for ChunkDescs and
                        ConfigChunks to a Tweek service.
Jun-09-2002 patrickh    Added a Python 2 script (xmlupdate.py) that can convert
                        config files created prior to version 0.2.0 to the new
                        format.
Jun-04-2002 patrickh    The process of making symlinks to the contents of
                        juggler/external/cppdom during the build process and
                        of installing CppDOM has been moved over to the
                        juggler/external mini build system.
May-31-2002 patrickh    Disabled performance collection code by default.  It is
                        currently unstable.  See SourceForge Bug #562680.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.1
May-24-2002 nonchocoboy Ported config subsystem to Tweek service.
May-23-2002 patrickh    Merged changes from jccl_file_format_change_branch.
            allenb      The JCCL C++ code now depends on CppDOM instead of
                        Xerces-C; the Java code depends on JDOM instead of
                        JAXP.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.0
May-23-2002 patrickh    Added jccl::ConfigChunk::getFullName() which returns
                        the fully qualified name of a chunk.  For child
                        chunks, the full name is the full path to the child.
May-22-2002 allenb      Updated to work with Boost 0.1.28.
May-19-2002 patrickh    Updated the ConfigUpdater utility to convert VR Juggler
                        1.0 configuration files to the second revision of the
                        XML file format.
May-13-2002 patrickh    Chunks are edited inline rather than being edited and
                        and then replaced in the chunk databases.
May-10-2002 patrickh    Chunk descriptions are edited inline rather than being
                        edited and then replaced in the description
                        databases.
May-09-2002 patrickh    Completely rewrote the loading and saving of config
                        files and chunk descriptions in VjControl.
                        Fixed the ConfigChunk Java API to match the C++ API.
May-08-2002 subatomic   Ported to cppdom.  xmlpp no longer required.
May-07-2002 patrickh    Default values are now associated with individual
                        properties.  As a result, there is no longer a
                        circular dependency between chunks and their
                        descriptions.
May-07-2002 allenb      Fix getProperty to specialize it for std::string 
                        and ChunkPtr's. I had to work around some bugs in
                        gcc's handling of member specialization, but the 
                        code is still standard so it should work on all 
                        compilers.  In the future if gcc ever fixes its 
                        implementation this code could be simplified a little.
May-06-2002 patrickh    Chunk descriptions use lower-case spellings for
                        property type identifiers.
May-06-2002 patrickh    Started work towards making config files and
                        description files case sensitive.
May-06-2002 patrickh    Finished removal of Xerces-C as a dependency.
May-06-2002 allenb      Added exception handling code for desc db load/save.
May-06-2002 allenb      Refactor to use new file format and xmlpp.
                          - Simplify config processing
                          - Remove all parsing code
                          - Use STL objects to simplify and reduce code         
                          - Replace VarValue with more general method that 
                              allows user-define types in properties
May-05-2002 allenb      Added code to config scripts to get xmlpp paths in.
May-05-2002 patrickh    Removed dependency on JAXP in favor of JDOM in the
                        Java code.
May-04-2002 patrickh    Initial support for loading and saving a version of
                        XML config files that requires no user-level parsing.
May-02-2002 allenb      Added test cases for ConfigChunk.
Apr-29-2002 nonchocoboy Modularized directory structure.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.1.0
Jan-11-2002 cjust       Made PerformanceMonitor a singleton.
Jan-08-2002 cjust       Testing equality of two "invalid" VarValues now
                        returns true.
                        Added a VarValue::isValid() convenience method.
Dec-29-2001 cjust       VjControl doesn't open multiple unsynchronized
                        copies of the same file anymore, and asks if the
                        user wants to revert to the saved copy.
Nov-30-2001 cjust       ConfigIO's API now uses const ints to explicitly
                        give the file format for reading/writing.  Most
                        callers of these APIs just use the default argument
                        for that parameter anyway, so the effect on user
                        code is small.
Oct-23-2001 cjust       Made JackalServer a singleton, allow JackalControls
                        to access its list of connections (e.g. for
                        broadcasting messages).
Oct-21-2001 cjust       Fixed registration of JackalControls.
Oct-12-2001 cjust       Updated to Allen's improved vprDebug registration
                        code.
Oct-09-2001 cjust       Optimized VjConfig.ValType to reduce number of
                        objects instatiated by configuration code.
Oct-05-2001 cjust       Replaced several explicit "parent" notifications in
                        VjControl with ActionEvent interfaces.  Cleaned up
                        message handling between the Performance module and
                        its related GUI components.
Sep-25-2001 cjust       Added various sample VjControl extensions.
Sep-20-2001 cjust       Refactored ConfigurationControl to provide a default
                        dynamic reconfiguration capability.  This should be
                        sufficient for most applications which wish to use
                        Jackal-based dynamic reconfiguration.
Sep-10-2001 cjust       Restructuring of Jackal source code & build system.
Aug-31-2001 cjust       Created the new "Jackal" module.

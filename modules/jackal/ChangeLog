Jul-08-2007 patrick     Debug-enabled code linked against the release runtime
                        on Windows is now named the same as optimized code.
                        The debug DLLs are installed in the "debug"
                        subdirectory. On non-Windows platforms, debug-enabled
                        plug-ins no longer use the "_d" name variation and are
                        installed in the "debug" subdirectory.
                        NEW VERSION: 1.3.3

                        instead of _DEBUG (and JCCL_OPT or JUGGLER_OPT instead
                        of _OPT).

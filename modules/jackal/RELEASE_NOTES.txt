    - See the ChangeLog for more system-level changes that do not directly
      affect applications.
    - See the Known Bugs page on the VR Juggler website (www.vrjuggler.org)
      for the current list of bugs.

===============================================================================

 Version: 1.0.1
Released: August 29, 2005
    This is a minor bug-fix release made as part of the release of
    VR Juggler 2.0.1.

 Version: 1.0.0
Released: July 5, 2005
    New in this release:
       * Support for Windows XP x64 Edition.

 Version: 1.0 Beta 3
Released: June 7, 2005

    The methods jccl::ConfigDefinition::assertValid(),
    jccl::ConfigElement::assertValid(), and
    jccl::PropertyDefinition::assertValid() have been removed.

 Version: 0.18.0
Released: September 17, 2004

    The config definition file format is now at version 3.1.  To update
    from version 3.0, use the transform code in the file
    tools/xmlupdate/jdef_3.0-3.1.xsl.  Updating to version 3.1 is required
    for .jdef files to be loaded by the C++ and the Java code.

 Version: 0.2.0
Released: May 23, 2002

    Major refactoring and re-writing of file-handling code in both the Java
    and the C++ aspects of JCCL has occurred.  The following describes the
    changes and explains what must be done to update from all previous
    versions.

    JCCL now uses CppDOM for C++ XML handling and JDOM for Java XML.  There
    are several aspects to this major change to JCCL:

        1. Config file format update
        2. API change
        3. Code simplification
        4. VjControl internal semantic differences

    The build documentation in juggler/INSTALL.{txt,html} has been
    updated to explain the requirements and how to configure the build.

    Config File Format
    ------------------

    The config files now require *no* user-level parsing.  This is an
    important change because it allows us to provide a much smoother
    upgrade path for future changes to the basic file format and to the
    structure of individual chunks.  We can now use XSLT to transform
    config files with a stylesheet, thereby upgrading them.  All of the
    sample configuration files have been updated to use the new format.

    Updating Existing XML Config Files
    ----------------------------------

    If you have custom XML-based config files that you want to update to
    the new changes, a Python script is available under tools/xmlupdate
    that will do the job.  Please refer to the README.txt in that
    directory for details.  At this time, the script only updates config
    chunk files, not chunk descriptions.

    Even after running the Python script and making hand modifications, it
    is recommended that config files be loaded and saved with the new
    VjControl.  You'll need to open each chunk individually (including
    embedded chunks) and click the "OK" button to commit any in-memory
    modifications.  The main reason this is necessary is because
    enumerations are not yet fully supported the way they had been.  Right
    now, the enumeration value is written to the config file instead of the
    symbolic name.  This will be fixed in the future.

    API Change
    ----------

    As part of this major change to JCCL, the jccl::ConfigChunk API has
    changed slightly.  The deprecated method jccl::ConfigChunk::getType()
    has finally been removed in favor of jccl::ConfigChunk::getDescToken().
    If you get a compile failure because getType() is undefined, change
    the code to use getDescToken().

    A more interesting change it that the getProperty() method now takes a
    template parameter.  For example, previous code would have looked like
    this:

        std::string prop_val = (std::string) chunk->getProperty("thingy");

    OR

        std::string prop_val = static_cast<std::string>(chunk->getProperty("thingy"));

    The same functionality is now realized as:

        std::string prop_val = chunk->getProperty<std::string>("thingy");

    The template parameter can be anything, but the most familiar types
    will be among the following:

        * int, unsigned int, long, short, etc.
        * bool
        * float
        * std::string
        * jccl::ConfigChunkPtr

    *** IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have any code that uses getProperty("name"),
    you must change it to use getName() instead.  "name" has not a property
    of a chunk since the original conversion to XML.  Code that uses
    getProperty("name") will cause an assertion failure.

 Version: 0.0.1 (dev build)
Started: September 5, 2001

    Separated JCCL (Juggler Configuration and Control Library) from the
    VR Juggler core.  It includes the following basic features:

        * Configuration file system, using XML-based data files that are
          parsed into ConfigChunks and ChunkDescs.

        * The Jackal Server, which can be added to an appliation to provide
          network-based monitoring and reconfiguration.

        * VjControl, client application for the Jackal Server.  VjControl is
          an extensible, componentized Java application.

        * Dynamic reconfiguration support code, imported from VR Juggler 
          Kernel, which allows the Jackal Server to reconfigure a running
          application in response to commands from VjControl.

        * Performance measurement library, which allows applications to
          timestamp parts of their source code.  The Jackal Server can
          write performance measurement information to a log file or send
          it across the network to VjControl.

    JCCL has the following external dependencies:

        * VPR (VR Juggler Portable Runtime) version 0.4.  See
          www.vrjuggler.org for information.

        * CppDOM.  See www.sourceforge.net/projects/xml-cppdom for
          information.

        * Java Development Kit 1.2 or better.  See java.sun.com.

        * JDOM.  See www.jdom.org

Jun-21-2001 subatomic Newest Juggler Audio is born.  Based on my previous two 
                      revisions, I've refactored the vjSoundManager into two parts.  
                      One part (core) that can stand alone as a useful reconfigurable 
                      sound adapter, and one part that allows VR Juggler to 
                      communicate with the core.  This newest derivitive of the 
                      VR Juggler sound manager finally allows runtime 
                      reconfiguration of the sounds and their respective sound 
                      implementations.  Also it allows extension of available 
                      sound drivers at runtime to help facilitate an always 
                      running system.  This iteration of the VR Juggler sound code 
                      will be called AudioJuggler.
Dec-05-2000 subatomic rewrote vjSoundManager to allow run-time reconfiguration
                      like all the other components of VR Juggler.
                      this code is a prototype, and is not yet good enough to go 
                      into the main distribution of VR Juggler.
Jun-17-2000 subatomic Created the VR Juggler vjSoundManager and associated 
                      classes which allow a VR juggler application to generically
                      use sound within an application.  vjSoundManager is 
                      essentially an adaptor to an underlying sound API, in this
                      case SL library, or Audioworks.

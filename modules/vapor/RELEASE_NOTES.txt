For all versions:

    - See the ChangeLog for more system-level changes that do not directly
      affect applications.

===============================================================================

 Version: 1.0.0
Released: <month> <day>, 2001

 Version: 0.3.0
Released: July 23, 2001
    New features:
        * The Boost C++ library is now integrated with VPR.

    Required changes when upgrading from 0.2.x:
        * vpr::Status has been renamed to vpr::ReturnStatus to work around a
          problem with the X Window System using Status as a #define symbol.
          Similarly, the header vpr/Util/Status.h is now named
          vpr/Util/ReturnStatus.h.

 Version: 0.2.5
Released: July 20, 2001

    New features:
        * Non-blocking socket connections can now time out.  If the
          connection does not complete within the given interval, the
          connection times out, and the caller must check again later to
          determine if the connection has completed.

 Version: 0.2.4
Released: July 17, 2001

    Required changes when upgrading from 0.2.x:
        * The out parameter to the read and write methods used to return the
          number of bytes read or written has changed types from ssize_t
          to vpr::Uint32.  -1 is no longer returned through this parameter
          to indicate error.  The method return value is sufficient to do
          this.

 Version: 0.2.3
Released: July 16, 2001

    The Win32 DLL works again.  It had been broken for use with datagram
    sockets.

    New features:
        * The definition of cross-platform types such as vpr::Socket and
          vpr::Thread have been moved into a single file called
          vpr/vprDomain.h.  Files such as vpr/Thread/Thread.h are now much
          simpler and now include only the appropriate platform-specific
          file(s).

 Version: 0.2.2
Released: July 13, 2001

    Improved stability.

    Required changes when upgrading from 0.2.1:
        * Test for vpr::Status::WouldBlock instead of vpr::Status::InProgress
          when using potentially blocking calls with non-blocking I/O
          devices.

    New features:
        * When using a non-blocking I/O device, all methods (except for
          vpr::Status;:connect()) return vpr::Status::WouldBlock if they
          would have blocked.

 Version: 0.2.1
Released: July 11, 2001

    New features:
        The internal I/O implementation classes no longer inherit from
        vpr::BlockIO.  This dramatically reduces the use of virtual functions
        and should improve performance in general.

 Version: 0.2.0
Released: July 2, 2001

    Identical to 0.1.0 but available from HEAD branch.

 Version: 0.1.0
Released: July 2, 2001

    First stable version--internal release only.  The API has been stabilized
    on RELENG_0_1 branch.  Only bug fixes are allowed in subsequent 0.1.x
    releases.

 Version: 0.0.3
Released: June 24, 2001

    Required changes when upgrading from 0.0.2:
        * All header files must be included as <vpr/path/to/file.h>.  In
          most cases, adding "vpr/" is sufficient.
        * The following directories have been renamed:
              o Threads --> Thread
              o Utils   --> Util
        * The following header files have been renamed:
              o Sync/Cond.h --> Sync/CondVar.h

    New features:
        * All I/O methods that can block now take a vpr::Interval argument
          giving the maximum time allowed for the action to complete.  All
          such arguments default to vpr::Interval::NoWait so that the API
          is not broken with respect to previous versions.

 Version: 0.0.2
Released: June 18, 2001

    Last version before total directory restructuring.

 Version: 0.0.1
Released: April 16, 2001

    Initial version.  This is the standalone version of VPR taken from the
    VR Juggler source tree.

                        Projections are now calculated immediately before
                        being used.  This allows the projections to take into
                        account the units that the application is using (feet
                        vs. meters vs. other).

                        This change should increate the performance of context
                        specific data in cases where we are using multiple
                        display pipes.  The most recent cubes test application
                        can help to give solid numbers for the new performance

Jul-01-2002 allenb      Temporary hack added to GlPipe.cpp to set viewport
                        before each call to draw.  This was needed to work

Jun-20-2002 allenb      Remove multi-threading from the case where GLXWindow and 
                        XWinKeyboard are sharing the window to process it as a 
                        GFX window and as a keyboard window.
                        This change should greatly increase the stability of GFX 
                        window input under X with OpenGL.

[1.1 DR1 released - 6.13.2002]=================================================
Jun-13-2002 patrickh  Removed vrj::EnvironmentManager.
May-30-2002 patrickh  Removed the Juggler_utils library.
                      NEW VERSION: 1.1.95
May-29-2002 patrickh  Installed dynamic libraries are now named based on the
                      VR Juggler version.
May-23-2002 patrickh  Updated to JCCL 0.2.0 API.
                      NEW VERSION: 1.1.94
May-22-2002 allenb    Updated to work with Boost 0.1.28.
May-03-2002 patrickh  Remvoed catadf.pl which has been obsoleted by Sonix
                      functionality.
Apr-23-2002 patrickh  Data files now install into $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler
                      by default.  This is done so that they do not conflict
                      with data files from other Juggler modules or system
                      data files.
                      NEW VERSION: 1.1.93
Apr-09-2002 allenb    The cyclic dependency between VR Juggler and Gadgeteer
            patrickh  has been broken.  VR Juggler and Gadgeteer have both
                      been ported to GMTL.
                      NEW VERSION: 1.1.92
Feb-27-2002 allenb    Added simple navigation to OpenSGNav app.
Feb-26-2002 istoynov  OpenSG application class added.  The OpenSG application
            reiners   class currently factors out all the commonality for
            allenb    OpenSG-based Juggler applications.
                      contributors: Ivan Stoynov & Dirk Reiners
Feb-22-2002 allenb    OpenSG app now uses MatrixCamera to render displays.
Jan-31-2002 allenb    Added SignalButtons init and check functions to the
                      Kernel.  The only "signal" being checked currently
                      is the VJSystemStopKernel button which triggers a kernel
                      stop call.
Jan-31-2002 allenb    Moved left and right projections from surface viewport
                      to the base viewport class.  Now simulator viewports
                      create to camera projections and just use one by default
                      This simplifies the code and eliminates some redundancy.
                      This should allow for stereo simulator views as well.
Jan-31-2002 allenb    Moved Projection Enum values into an Enum named Eye.
Jan-31-2002 allenb    Removed unneeded mType parameter from Projection classes.
Jan-31-2002 allenb    Modified viewports to have handles to parent displays,
                      and projections to have handles to parent viewports.
                      This enabled camera projection to be calculated
                      in CameraProjection class and to auto calculate
                      the aspect ratio.
                      Now CameraProjection actually calculates a frutum
                      so we do not have to use a special case for
                      simulator camera rendering where we use gluPerspective.
Jan-30-2002 allenb    Changed order that oglApp functions are called.  Now
                      contextInit() is called before bufferPreDraw().
Jan-29-2002 allenb    Added new interface function oglApp::contextPostDraw()
Nov-14-2001 allenb    Fixed OsgApp to allow for multi-window/multi-pipe apps.
                      Added method for configuring new osgUtil::SceneViewers.
Oct-17-2001 subatomic Fixed bug where vjGetVjMatrix returns the wrong 
                      conversion.
Oct-17-2001 patrick   Renamed the "Data" directory to "data".
Oct-15-2001 patrick   Renamed the juggler-config script to vrjuggler-config.
Oct-12-2001 allenb    Removed vrj::Debug.  We now use vpr::Debug for all
                      debug output.  This involved introducing GUIDs for the 
                      vrj debug categories.  They can be found in Debug.h
Oct-11-2001 allenb    Added fix for synchronization errors when reading input
                      from a GlWindowXwin as a keyboard device.
Sep-21-2001 patrick   Complete restructuring of the VR Juggler source tree.
                      Headers are now rooted in a vrj directory (to match the
                      namespace), and all file names have had the "vj" prefix
                      removed.  See RELEASE_NOTES.txt for more details on
                      updating after this change.
Sep-20-2001 patrick   The default chunk description file for VR Juggler is now
                      vrj-chunks.desc.
Sep-19-2001 subatomic Added compatibility include files put 
                      -I$(VJ_BASE_DIR)/include/deprecated in your makefile.
Sep-19-2001 subatomic Now using the vrj namespace instead of the prefix "vj"
                      on classes.
Aug-27-2001 patrick   We build DLLs on Win32 now.
Aug-24-2001 allenb    Moved glWindow factory function to glDrawManager.
                      This removes the dependency that Juggler had on
                      Juggler_ogl.
Aug-22-2001 cjust     Added XML-based configuration file support to the
                      C++ side of Juggler (EnvironmentManager and ConfigIO
                      classes).
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Added a VjControl wizard for creating simulator-mode
                      configuration files.
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Merged support for XML-based configuration files in
                      VjControl.  VjControl now requires JAXP (Java API for
                      XML processing).
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Added an improved default-value handling for ChunkDescs.
                      Default values are now stored in the .desc files, and
                      are editable directly from the ChunkDesc editing window
                      in VjControl.  (This requires XML-format ChunkDesc 
                      files).
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Updated VjControl's protocol-selection system to use
                      the new XML-like syntax.  This breaks communication
                      with older versions of VR Juggler.
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Fixed a redraw bug in VjControl that happened when
                      updating the Active chunkdb from a network connection.
                      This could cause the status bar label or the chunkdb's
                      JTree to be shifted to the upper-left corner of the
                      VjControl window.
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Added lazy initialization of VjControl panels; this
                      cuts startup time and improves scalability.
Aug-20-2001 cjust     VjControl is no longer built into a compressed .jar
                      file.  This cuts several seconds off startup time.
Aug-10-2001 allenb    Added initial version of OSG (www.openscenegraph.org) 
                      support to VR Juggler.
                      This introduces and new application class called vjOsgApp
                      that all OSG-based apps should derive from.
                      There is also a new sample program called osgNav that 
                      uses this class to create a basic navigation program.
Aug-06-2001 allenb    tools/pfStatLinux contains a library that must be used
                      with performer application on Linux due to a bug in
                      performer.
Jun-20-2001 allenb    Chunk types: simDisplay and surfaceDisplay have been
                      removed from the system.  They have been replaced
                      by the new chunk of type displayWindow.  Any old
                      chunks will be ignored.
Jun-20-2001 patrick   The Mac OS X port no longer requires Carbon SetupGL
                      because the necessary SetupGL code has been copied into
                      the library
Jun-19-2001 allenb    Performer now fully uses run-time reconfiguration at
                      startup and allows for the addition of new display
                      windows at run-time.
Jun-11-2001 allenb    First pass at (re)configurable pfDrawManager
                      Currently only allows run-time addition of windows. 
May-21-2001 patrick   Initial attempt to support HP-UX 11.x.  A newer version
                      of Doozer++ is needed before the port can be completed.
May-02-2001 allenb    Added new sync string descriptions to flock of birds
                      chunk.  Added: CRT_Above_72hz and CRT_Below_72hz
                      NOTE: This BREAKS old config files that had "Normal_72hz"
Apr-12-2001 patrick   The MotionStar driver now supports setting the
                      measurement rate
Apr-03-2001 allenb    Refactored the vjDisplayManager to support viewports
                      within display windows. This removes the old surface and
                      simulator display classes and replaces them with new
                      viewport based equivalents.
                      This change also updates the vjGlDrawManager to
                      support the new viewport abilities.  The pfDrawManager
                      however does not work yet.
                      This also changes the display configuration chunks and
                      (unfortunately) completely breaks backwards
                      compatibility with display configuration chunks.
Apr-03-2001 allenb    Added vjGlApp::bufferPreDraw method to the vjGlApp
                      interface.  This was needed because of the new viewport
                      rendering abilities.  All applications must now execute
                      glClear's ONLY within bufferPreDraw().
Mar-28-2001 subatomic vjQuat interface is more fully featured, and now 
                      contains documentation.  Added tan and atan to vjSystem
Mar-01-2001 patrick   Added support for a new environment variable $VJ_CFG_PATH
                      that allows users to specify a colon-separated path (or
                      semi-colon-separated on Win32) where config files can
                      be found.  This alleviates the need to specify the full
                      path all the time.
Feb-17-2001 patrick   Added support for NSPR as an operating system
                      abstraction.  The operating system abstraction layer has
                      been completely restructured into the VR Juggler
                      Portable Runtime (VPR).  This code is now compiled into
                      the Juggler_utils library.  Warnings have been added to
                      deprecated header files to let programmers know to
                      update their paths.  The vjDebug code has also been
                      moved into the Juggler_utils library so that any code
                      can use it without being tied to the primary Juggler
                      library.  The vjSystem interface has been started.  It
                      provides static inline functions such as sleep(),
                      usleep(), gettimeofday(), cos(), atan2, and sqrt().
Feb-07-2001 patrick   The extra VR Juggler data files, sample applications,
                      sample config files, etc. now install in
                      $VJ_BASE_DIR/share by default.  This includes the
                      basic chunk description file, so local vjcontrol.cfg
                      files must be updated.  The easiest way to do this is
                      to change the descfiles property to have the value
                      "$VJ_SHARE_DIR/Data/chunksDesc".  VjControl knows how to
                      expand $VJ_SHARE_DIR on its own.
Feb-05-2001 allenb    Major refactoring of Input Manager and Input classes
                      Rewrote InputManager class removing redundancy and
                      using templates classes to capture commonality.
                      Redesigned input class hierarchy.
                      Replaced proxies with typedef'ed template classes.  
Jan-27-2001 patrick   The Juggler_utils library must now be linked for all
                      applications.
Jan-26-2001 cjust     Improved Navigation in VjControl help.
Jan-20-2001 cjust     VjControl now recommends JDK1.3 (1.2 still minimum).
Jan-09-2001 patrick   RELENG_1_0 CVS branch created in preparation for 1.0
                      release.  This was branched at the same point as the
                      now defunct RELENG_0_2 branch.  The HEAD is now moving
                      towards 1.2.

[1.0 release brach created - 1.9.2001]=========================================
Dec-30-2000 patrick   Build system converted to use Doozer++ 1.0.  Automake 1.4
                      is now required for compiling in addition to Autoconf.
                      Use autogen.sh to do the auto generation phase before
                      compiling.
Dec-28-2000 patrick   Added initial version of serial and socket I/O
                      abstraction layers.  These are to be used for making
                      cross-platform drivers with very little effort.
Dec-17-2000 bthomp    UNIX version of IS-900 driver converted to use termios
                      which in turn fixes cross-platform building
Dec-13-2000 patrick   RELENG_0_2 CVS branch created in preparation for 0.2.0
                      release

[0.2 release brach created - 12.13.2000]=======================================
Nov-27-2000 bthomp    Added initial version of Intersense IS-900 driver
Nov-02-2000 patrick   Finished new MotionStar driver--config files must be
                      updated to reflect some new options
Oct-28-2000 allenb    Fixed bug preventing right eye only mono in Performer
Sep-30-2000 allenb    Moved src to SourceForge.net
Sep-18-2000 allenb    Added interocular distance configuration
Sep-15-2000 patrick   Fixed positioning of keyboard input windows on Win32
Sep-03-2000 allenb    Fixed a couple of race conditions on start up.
Sep-03-2000 allenb    Fixed bug that prevented X-Win keyboards from
                      reconfiguring
Sep-02-2000 allenb    Fixed several lingering seg fault bugs
Aug-30-2000 allenb    Added ability to specify FOV and aspect ratio in sim
                      windows.
Aug-29-2000 allenb    Fixed bug with Performer calling app traversals
                      once per channel.
Aug-21-2000 allenb    Added initial trackd driver support
Aug-05-2000 patrick   Now using std namespace for all C++ I/O
Aug-03-2000 patrick   -LANG:std is now used when compiling on IRIX
Jul-18-2000           VR Juggler 0.1.97 released

[Version 0.1.97 - 7.19.2000]===================================================
Jul-13-2000 cjust     Environment Manager works under NT
                      Config files can have includes for chunkdesc files
                      Config file includes now use relative paths correctly
                      Vjcontrol fixes for editing embedded chunks
                      Vjcontrol internal event architecture expanded
                      Vjcontrol componentization (partial)
                      Numerous fixes in ConfigChunkDB code
Jul-13-2000 allenb    Initial ChangeLog file started
Jul-11-2000 allenb    Rewrote the way that threads call self()
                      Rewrote thread specific data
                      Threads are now much faster (~10x)
Jul-07-2000 patrick   Debugging symbols are now compiled into object files on
                      Win32 which fixes long-standing (but unreported)
                      problems with linking Juggler applications.
Jun-29-2000 cjust     Java 1.1 compatability has been dropped from VjControl
Jun-23-2000 patrick   Set the stereo bit in an OpenGL window on Win32 if
                      stereo is enabled in the windwo's config chunk.
                      _OLD_TERMIOS is no longer set on IRIX.  The serial
                      drivers are using the latest termios functions.  This
                      code will probably not work on versions of IRIX before
                      6.5 as a result.
                      Added the new utility library Juggler_utils which is
                      required by most, if not all, applications after this
                      date.
Jun-17-2000 subatomic SoundManager added, juggler sound engine for audioworks 
                      is available.
Jun-08-2000 allenb    vjApp no longer needs to be passed a vjKernel instance
Jun-06-2000 subatomic vjGetVJMatrix() has been renamed to vjGetVjMatrix()

[ Version 0.1.96 - 3.10.2000 ]=================================================

                      - Improved the run-time reconfiguration
                      - Performer works now in Linux and Irix
                      - Increased performance

                     VjControl
                      - Redesigned internals, rewritten to support 
                        componentization.
                      - Flexible event handling architechture.
                      
[ Beta 1 ]=====================================================================
7.1.1999             Rewrote kernel
                     Added dynamic run-time configuration
                     Bug fixes
                     
[ Alpha 4 ]====================================================================
2.13.1999            Added Glove Support
                     - Added glove device abstraction
                     - Added simulated glove device
                     - Added glove proxy and interface classes

DATE        AUTHOR    CHANGE
----------- --------- ---------------------------------------------------------
Oct-17-2001 patrick   Renamed the "Data" directory to "data".
Oct-15-2001 patrick   Renamed the juggler-config script to vrjuggler-config.
Oct-12-2001 allenb    Removed vrj::Debug.  We now use vpr::Debug for all
                      debug output.  This involved introducing GUIDs for the 
                      vrj debug categories.  They can be found in Debug.h
Oct-11-2001 allenb    Added fix for synchronization errors when reading input
                      from a GlWindowXwin as a keyboard device.
Sep-21-2001 patrick   Complete restructuring of the VR Juggler source tree.
                      Headers are now rooted in a vrj directory (to match the
                      namespace), and all file names have had the "vj" prefix
                      removed.  See RELEASE_NOTES.txt for more details on
                      updating after this change.
Sep-20-2001 patrick   The default chunk description file for VR Juggler is now
                      vrj-chunks.desc.
Sep-19-2001 kevn      Now using the vrj namespace instead of the prefix "vj"
                      on classes.
Aug-27-2001 patrick   We build DLLs on Win32 now.
Aug-24-2001 allenb    Moved glWindow factory function to glDrawManager.
                      This removes the dependency that Juggler had on
                      Juggler_ogl.
Aug-22-2001 cjust     Added XML-based configuration file support to the
                      C++ side of Juggler (EnvironmentManager and ConfigIO
                      classes).
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Added a VjControl wizard for creating simulator-mode
                      configuration files.
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Merged support for XML-based configuration files in
                      VjControl.  VjControl now requires JAXP (Java API for
                      XML processing).
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Added an improved default-value handling for ChunkDescs.
                      Default values are now stored in the .desc files, and
                      are editable directly from the ChunkDesc editing window
                      in VjControl.  (This requires XML-format ChunkDesc 
                      files).
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Updated VjControl's protocol-selection system to use
                      the new XML-like syntax.  This breaks communication
                      with older versions of VR Juggler.
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Fixed a redraw bug in VjControl that happened when
                      updating the Active chunkdb from a network connection.
                      This could cause the status bar label or the chunkdb's
                      JTree to be shifted to the upper-left corner of the
                      VjControl window.
Aug-20-2001 cjust     Added lazy initialization of VjControl panels; this
                      cuts startup time and improves scalability.
Aug-20-2001 cjust     VjControl is no longer built into a compressed .jar
                      file.  This cuts several seconds off startup time.
Aug-10-2001 allenb    Added initial version of OSG (www.openscenegraph.org) 
                      support to VR Juggler.
                      This introduces and new application class called vjOsgApp
                      that all OSG-based apps should derive from.
                      There is also a new sample program called osgNav that 
                      uses this class to create a basic navigation program.
Aug-06-2001 allenb    tools/pfStatLinux contains a library that must be used
                      with performer application on Linux due to a bug in
                      performer.
Jun-20-2001 allenb    Chunk types: simDisplay and surfaceDisplay have been
                      removed from the system.  They have been replaced
                      by the new chunk of type displayWindow.  Any old
                      chunks will be ignored.
Jun-20-2001 patrick   The Mac OS X port no longer requires Carbon SetupGL
                      because the necessary SetupGL code has been copied into
                      the library
Jun-19-2001 allenb    Performer now fully uses run-time reconfiguration at
                      startup and allows for the addition of new display
                      windows at run-time.
Jun-11-2001 allenb    First pass at (re)configurable pfDrawManager
                      Currently only allows run-time addition of windows. 
May-21-2001 patrick   Initial attempt to support HP-UX 11.x.  A newer version
                      of Doozer++ is needed before the port can be completed.
May-02-2001 allenb    Added new sync string descriptions to flock of birds
                      chunk.  Added: CRT_Above_72hz and CRT_Below_72hz
                      NOTE: This BREAKS old config files that had "Normal_72hz"
Apr-12-2001 patrick   The MotionStar driver now supports setting the
                      measurement rate
Apr-03-2001 allenb    Refactored the vjDisplayManager to support viewports
                      within display windows. This removes the old surface and
                      simulator display classes and replaces them with new
                      viewport based equivalents.
                      This change also updates the vjGlDrawManager to
                      support the new viewport abilities.  The pfDrawManager
                      however does not work yet.
                      This also changes the display configuration chunks and
                      (unfortunately) completely breaks backwards
                      compatibility with display configuration chunks.
Apr-03-2001 allenb    Added vjGlApp::bufferPreDraw method to the vjGlApp
                      interface.  This was needed because of the new viewport
                      rendering abilities.  All applications must now execute
                      glClear's ONLY within bufferPreDraw().
Mar-28-2001 kevn      vjQuat interface is more fully featured, and now 
                      contains documentation.  Added tan and atan to vjSystem
Mar-01-2001 patrick   Added support for a new environment variable $VJ_CFG_PATH
                      that allows users to specify a colon-separated path (or
                      semi-colon-separated on Win32) where config files can
                      be found.  This alleviates the need to specify the full
                      path all the time.
Feb-17-2001 patrick   Added support for NSPR as an operating system
                      abstraction.  The operating system abstraction layer has
                      been completely restructured into the VR Juggler
                      Portable Runtime (VPR).  This code is now compiled into
                      the Juggler_utils library.  Warnings have been added to
                      deprecated header files to let programmers know to
                      update their paths.  The vjDebug code has also been
                      moved into the Juggler_utils library so that any code
                      can use it without being tied to the primary Juggler
                      library.  The vjSystem interface has been started.  It
                      provides static inline functions such as sleep(),
                      usleep(), gettimeofday(), cos(), atan2, and sqrt().
Feb-07-2001 patrick   The extra VR Juggler data files, sample applications,
                      sample config files, etc. now install in
                      $VJ_BASE_DIR/share by default.  This includes the
                      basic chunk description file, so local vjcontrol.cfg
                      files must be updated.  The easiest way to do this is
                      to change the descfiles property to have the value
                      "$VJ_SHARE_DIR/Data/chunksDesc".  VjControl knows how to
                      expand $VJ_SHARE_DIR on its own.
Feb-05-2001 allenb    Major refactoring of Input Manager and Input classes
                      Rewrote InputManager class removing redundancy and
                      using templates classes to capture commonality.
                      Redesigned input class hierarchy.
                      Replaced proxies with typedef'ed template classes.  
Jan-27-2001 patrick   The Juggler_utils library must now be linked for all
                      applications.
Jan-26-2001 cjust     Improved Navigation in VjControl help.
Jan-20-2001 cjust     VjControl now recommends JDK1.3 (1.2 still minimum).
Jan-09-2001 patrick   RELENG_1_0 CVS branch created in preparation for 1.0
                      release.  This was branched at the same point as the
                      now defunct RELENG_0_2 branch.  The HEAD is now moving
                      towards 1.2.

[1.0 release brach created - 1.9.2001]=========================================
Dec-30-2000 patrick   Build system converted to use Doozer++ 1.0.  Automake 1.4
                      is now required for compiling in addition to Autoconf.
                      Use autogen.sh to do the auto generation phase before
                      compiling.
Dec-28-2000 patrick   Added initial version of serial and socket I/O
                      abstraction layers.  These are to be used for making
                      cross-platform drivers with very little effort.
Dec-17-2000 bthomp    UNIX version of IS-900 driver converted to use termios
                      which in turn fixes cross-platform building

Jul-18-2000           VR Juggler 0.1.97 released

[Version 0.1.97 - 7.19.2000]===================================================
Jul-13-2000 cjust     Environment Manager works under NT
                      Config files can have includes for chunkdesc files
                      Config file includes now use relative paths correctly
                      Vjcontrol fixes for editing embedded chunks
                      Vjcontrol internal event architecture expanded
                      Vjcontrol componentization (partial)

                      Threads are now much faster (~10x)
Jul-07-2000 patrick   Debugging symbols are now compiled into object files on
                      Win32 which fixes long-standing (but unreported)
                      problems with linking Juggler applications.
Jun-29-2000 cjust     Java 1.1 compatability has been dropped from VjControl
Jun-23-2000 patrick   Set the stereo bit in an OpenGL window on Win32 if
                      stereo is enabled in the windwo's config chunk.
                      _OLD_TERMIOS is no longer set on IRIX.  The serial
                      drivers are using the latest termios functions.  This
                      code will probably not work on versions of IRIX before
                      6.5 as a result.
                      Added the new utility library Juggler_utils which is
                      required by most, if not all, applications after this
                      date.
Jun-17-2000 kevn      SoundManager added, juggler sound engine for audioworks

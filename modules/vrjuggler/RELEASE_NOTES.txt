                           VR Juggler Release Notes
                           ------------------------

For all versions:

    - See the ChangeLog for more system-level changes that do not directly
      affect applications.
    - See the Known Bugs page on the VR Juggler website (www.vrjuggler.org)
      for the current list of bugs.

===============================================================================

 Version: 2.0.1
Released: ???

    In general, there are no required application or configuration changes
    to update from VR Juggler 2.0.0 to 2.0.1.  Nevertheless, all users
    updating to 2.0.1 should read the following carefully:

       * The VR Juggler Performer Draw Manager no longer calls pfExit()
         when it is shut down.  Instead, users who want to ensure that
         Performer cleans up its resources should put a call to pfExit()
         at the very end of their application main() function.  The call
         to pfExit() must be the last call in main().

 Version: 2.0.0
Released: July 5, 2005

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.0.0:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/MigratingToVrjTwo

    In general, there are no required application or configuration changes
    to update from VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 3 to 2.0.0.  To update from
    2.0 Alpha 4, please refer to the instructions below for VR Juggler 2.0
    Beta 1.

    New in this release:
       * Support for Windows XP x64 Edition.
       * Improved stabilitiy for Open Scene Graph applications, especially
         in multi-threaded, multi-pipe configurations.
       * OpenGL display windows are closed cleanly now, and overrides of
         vrj::GlApp::contextClose() are invoked.

 Version: 2.0 Beta 3 (1.1.172-0)
Released: June 7, 2005

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 3:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/MigratingToVrjTwo

    In general, there are no required application or configuration changes
    to update from VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 2 to 2.0 Beta 3.  To update from
    2.0 Alpha 4, please refer to the instructions below for VR Juggler 2.0
    Beta 1.  All users updating to 2.0 Beta 3 should read the following
    carefully:

       * Users of OpenSG and VR Juggler with application objects derived
         from vrj::OpenSGApp should verify three things:

          1) If vrj::App::getDrawScaleFactor() is overridden, make sure
             that the method returns the correct scaling value.
          2) Requests for position matrices from gadget::PositionInterface
             (or gadget::PositionProxy) objects should use the same
             conversion factor that is returned by getDrawScaleFactor().
          3) The application scene graph does not have an extraneous scale
             node left over from older VR Juggler releases.  There is no
             need to perform manual scene scaling to handle proper
             rendering.

       * More parameters can now be configured in the OpenGL frame
         buffer settings for display windows.  Users are encouraged to
         load all local .jconf files containing display_window config
         elements into VRJConfig to be updated.  (After the automatic
         update, click the "Save All" button to save the updates.)  The
         update is not required, but it is recommended.

 Version: 2.0 Beta 2 (1.1.167-0)
Released: January 18, 2005

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 2:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/MigratingToVrjTwo

    There are no required application or configuration changes to update
    from VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 1 to 2.0 Beta 2.  To update from 2.0 Alpha 4,
    please refer to the instructions below for VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 1.

    This release includes many bug fixes and feature enhancements &
    additions to VRJConfig.  In particular, custom editors have been
    added for configuring Ascension MotionStar Wireless and Ascension
    Flock of Birds devices.  All bugs reported with VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 1
    have been fixed.

 Version: 2.0 Beta 1 (1.1.166-0)
Released: December 24, 2004

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 1:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/MigratingToVrjTwo

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 2.0 Alpha 1 up through 2.0 Alpha 4):

        * XSLT has been added to allow upgrading from old configuration
          files easier. The following directory contains a collection of
          XSLT stylesheets that can be used for updating XML-based
          VR Juggler/JCCL configuration files.  The update process is
          iterative with each step corresponding to one release of VR Juggler.

             $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/xslt/

          All .jconf files created for VR Juggler 2.0 Alpha 4 or any version
          of the code since that release must be updated using the script
          2.0a4-2.0b1.xsl.  Changes were made since 2.0 Alpha 4 that cannot
          be expressed with the automated updating built in to VRJConfig.

        * After you have performed the update, you should load the migrated
          configuration file using VRJConfig to complete the update process
          and to review your configuration.  Some additions to the XML
          content may be made automatically, and generic identifiers are
          often used for these additions.  Using VRJConfig, you can make
          customizations for your specific configuration.

        * Custom configuration definitions (.jdef files) must be updated to
          versrion 3.1 of the definition file format.  Use the following
          XSLT to perform the update on all your custom .jdef files:

             $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/jccl/tools/xmlupdate/jdef_3.0-3.1.xsl

        * gadget::EventWindow has been renamed to use the more meaningful
          name gadget::KeyboardMouse.  Application objects using
          gadget::EventWindowInterface must simply change the name of the
          type to gadget::KeyboardMouseInterface.

        * The method vrj::OpenSGApp::getSceneRoot() has been renamed to
          vrj::OpenSGApp::getScene() to be in line with the OpenGL Performer
          and OSG application object base classes.

        * The use of GMTL 0.4.5 may require application changes to fix
          compile errors.  Refer to the following explanation of what to
          do if uses of gmtl::Vec* cause compile errors:

             http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=9550350

         * The Sonix class sonix is now in the snx namespace.  To update,
           change calls to snx::sonix or add 'using namespace snx;' to your
           code.

         * VPR_PROFILE() has been renamed to VPR_PROFILE_GUARD().
           VPR_PROFILE_HISTORY() has been renamed to
           VPR_PROFILE_GUARD_HISTORY().

         * The pseudo-device TweekGadget has been removed from Gadgeteer.
           Its sole purpose was to work around the lack of support for
           shared application-specific data in a cluster configuration.
           That feature has existed since VR Juggler 2.0 Alpha 1, and
           therefore, TweekGadget had out-lived its usefullness a long
           time ago.  Users of TweekGadget must switch their code to use
           the Tweek Java and C++ APIs directly in conjunction with the
           Gadgeteer type cluster::UserData<T> for sharing arbitrary
           application-specific data structures.  Programmer's unfamiliar
           with the direct use of the Tweek C++ and Java APIs are
           referred to the Tweek /Programmer's Guide/:

              http://www.vrjuggler.org/tweek/docs.php

 Version: 2.0 Alpha 4 (1.1.150-0)
Released: April 28, 2004

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.0 Alpha 4:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/MigratingToVrjTwo

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 2.0 Alpha 1 up through 2.0 Alpha 3):

        * XSLT has been added to allow upgrading from old configuration
          files easier. The following directory contains a collection of
          XSLT stylesheets that can be used for updating XML-based
          VR Juggler/JCCL configuration files.  The update process is
          iterative with each step corresponding to one release of VR Juggler.

               $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/xslt/

        * After you have performed the update, you should load the generated
          configuration file using VRJConfig and review your configuration.
          Some additions to the XML content may be made, and generic
          identifiers are often used for these additions.  Using VRJConfig,
          you can make customizations for your specific configuration.


                            Performance Monitoring
                            ======================

     Added the ability to acquire performance statistics in order to analyze
     the different parts of your application and VR Juggler. The interface
     is very clean and easy to use. There are three macros that can be used:


         * VPR_PROFILE("MyDraw")

            - Creates a guard that adds a timesample to the entry in the
              profile tree with the given name.

         * VPR_PROFILE_HISTORY("MyDraw", num)

            - Creates a guard that adds a timesample to the entry in the
              profile tree with the given name and also keep a record
              of the past num samples.

         * VPR_PROFILE_RESULTS()

            - Prints the profile tree: giving the number of calls, total time,
              average time, and last num samples.


                           Run Time Reconfiguration
                           ========================

     Implemented the CORBA-based remote run-time reconfiguration feature of
     VRJConfig which had been missing for quite a while.  VR Juggler now has
     an exceptionally robust, multi-language architecture for reconfiguring
     running applications with external tools. The C++/CORBA part of the
     remote reconfiguration feature is loaded as a plug-in at run time.
     This allows us to distribute pre-compiled code without requiring that
     everyone have omniORB installed just to be able to try out VR Juggler.
     Improved the ability of various parts of the C++ code to be
     reconfigurable.  Most notably ensuring that device drivers can be
     reconfigured correctly.

                                  VRJConfig
                                  =========

     Replaced the old JTreeTable with a much better looking TableLayout that
     visualizes the structure of the configuration in a more useful manner.
     Implemented are the much-desired features of drag & drop, copy & paste,
     and undo/redo. You can now drag configuration elements between
     configuration contexts.


                          Config Element Versioning
                          =========================

     Automatic updating of out-of-date configuration elements has been added.
     VRJConfig can detect when a configuration element is out of date with
     respect to its definition. Through the magic of XSLT, the configuration
     element can be transformed into the new version automatically.  This means
     that manual updating of configuration files will be a thing of the past
     for about 99% of the cases.  (XSLT is not perfect, but it works pretty
     darn well.)  With the addition of XML Schema support for structural
     validation of XML input, we are now reaching a point where the full
     potential of XML is being realized for VR Juggler.


                    Config Element Definition Inheritance
                    =====================================

     Work has been completed for adding inheritance to configuration
     definitions.  VRJConfig can now handle configuration elements in a more
     abstract manner.  For example, consider the following snippets of
     configuration definition files (input_device.jdef,
     positional_device.jdef, and flock.jdef):

         <definition name="input_device" ...>
           <definition_version version="1" ...>
             <property name="device_host" ...>
               ...
             </property>
           </definition_version>
         </deinition>

         <definition name="positional_device" ...>
           <definition_version version="1" ...>
             <parent>input_device</parent>
             <property name="position_filters" ...>
               ...
             </property>
           </definition_version>
         </definition>

         <definition name="flock" ...>
           <definition_version version="1" ...>
             <parent>positional_device</parent>
               ...
           </definition_version>
         </definition>

     The configuration element for the Ascension Flock of Birds inherits from
     'positional_device' which in turn inherits from 'input_device'.  Thus,
     it gets the properties of device_host (needed for the cluster support)
     and position_filters (needed for all positional devices) automatically
     without having to redefine them.  VRJConfig can now handle instances of
     the 'flock' element type as instances of 'positional_device' or
     'input_device'.  There are a lot of benefits of this capability,
     although the most useful one for many users is that custom configuration
     elements can now be integrated into the configuration editing process
     seamlessly.  For example, if you are writing your own device driver,
     you can make its configuration definition inherit from the appropriate
     base types, and then proxy pointers, custom editors, etc. can handle
     your definition type without requiring modification to the "core" files
     that come with a VR Juggler distribution.


                          VRJConfig - Custom Editors
                          ==========================

     Much work has been put into the design of high-level editors for
     complex tasks such as device configuration including proxies, aliases,
     and screen placement for projection VR systems.  These pieces
     are still being worked on and represent some of the most cutting-edge
     features of VRJConfig.  In the case of device configuration, the first
     custom editor developed was for the Intersense tracking system. You
     can create a VR Juggler configuration from the ground up using a very
     intuitive interface that greatly simplifies the complexity of this task.


                             VRJConfig - Wizards
                             ===================

     Wizards have been added into VRJConfig to simplify the creation of
     general purpose configurations. These include a wizard that steps
     the user through all steps necessary to create a clustered simulator
     configuration. This is a rather new feature and will be expanded
     in the future.


                           Building Device Drivers
                           =======================

     Related to people writing their own device drivers, the Gadgeteer
     build system has been revamped to make it much, much easier for users to
     compile their device driver plug-ins with all the correct options.  It
     is now possible for developers to write a *four-line* makefile that will
     build a device driver correctly on all supported platforms.


                VR Juggler dynamic application loader/launcher
                ==============================================

     The basic idea with this application is to allow remote launching of
     dynamically loaded VR Juggler application objects.  In other words, it
     realizes a goal we have had for a long time: a VR Juggler daemon.  If
     you would like to check it out, it is in the VR Juggler Toolbox CVS
     repository in the module 'vrjugglerd' (go to http://vrjtoolbox.sf.net/
     if you're not familiar with the VR Juggler Toolbox).

     The vrjugglerd application is quite simple--surprisingly so.  At this
     time, it loads application objects written in C++, but it has been
     designed to allow loading of code from other languages.  In particular,
     Python and .NET are the two primary non-C++ language options, and support
     for dynamically loading application objects written in those language
     platforms will be added very soon.

     Below is an example configuration element that shows how to dynamically
     load an application using vrjugglerd.


         <vrjuggler_app_loader name="Cubes Loader" version="1">
           <app_object>
             <vrj_cpp_app name="Cubes App" version="1">
               <search_path>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/share/vrjuggler/test/Draw/OGL/cubes</search_path>
               <application>cubes</application>
             </vrj_cpp_app>
           </app_object>
         </vrjuggler_app_loader>


     This configuration element indicates that a shared library containing
     the code for the cubes application will be loaded. This version of
     cubes has no main() function whatsoever--it is simply a shared
     library (DLL) with a well-defined entry point that returns a
     vrj::App*. With this configuration file, it is assumed that vrjugglerd
     has already loaded a configuration for displays and input devices, but
     the vrjugglerd configuration can specify additional files to be loaded
     for use with the application object.  (Among other things, this allows
     dynamic inclusion of application-specific config elements to allow the
     newly loaded application object to be configured as necessary.)

     VRJConfig connects to a running vrjugglerd and sends the config element
     in the attached file to vrjugglerd.  As a result, the code for cubes is
     loaded dynamically from disk, a new GL window is opened, and the VR
     Juggler kernel control loop starts executing the dynamically loaded
     code.  (All of this can be done from the command line instead, but
     that's not nearly as interesting.)


                                 Build System
                                 ============

     There have been a few major changes to the build system of VR Juggler
     in order to try to make the process easier for the end user.

         * External Dependencies

             - The cvs-gather script is no longer being used to pull anything
               from different CVS repositories into a checked out copy of the
               Juggler Project source.

             - Doozer and Doozer++ come with the VR Juggler source during a
               CVS checkout.  Both are on vendor branches that will be updated
               as the need presents itself.

             - GMTL, on the other hand, must now be installed externally prior
               to building VR Juggler.  Similar to CppDOM, GMTL requires SCons
               to be installed, but since the GMTL C++ interface is entirely
               in headers, there is nothing to build.

         * Windows Build

             - Cygwin is no longer required for any part of building the
               Juggler Project--including VR Juggler applications.

             - The code is built now using a Visual Studio solution that ties
               together a bunch of Visual C++ projects.

             - Unlike the Cygwin build, the Visual Studio build supports both
               debug and release binaries.

 Version: 2.0 Alpha 3 (1.1.143-1)
Released: September 22, 2003

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.0 Alpha 3:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/MigratingToVrjTwo

    VR Juggler Alpha 3 is being released in order to allow the VR Juggler user
    community access to a stabilized snapshot of the current code base. There
    have been no additional features added to VR Juggler since VR Juggler
    Alpha 2. Also there have been no API changes since the Alpha 2 release.

 Version: 2.0 Alpha 2 (1.1.143)
Released: July 1, 2003

    Please refer to the following to get started with VR Juggler 2.0 Alpha 2:

       http://www.vrjuggler.org/twiki_public/bin/view/Juggler/MigratingToVrjTwo

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 2.0 Alpha 1):
        * KeyboardWindows are now referred to as EventWindows.

            NOTE: DisplayWindows which contain sim_viewports are required to
                  have the act_as_event_source property enabled.

        * The ClusterManager loads ClusterPlugins on demand now. The
          ClusterManager chunk must contain a lit of plugins which it should
          load. For example if you wish to load the RemoteInputManager,
          ApplicationDataManager, StartBarrierPlugin, and the
          SwapLockTCPPlugin you would have the following:

            <ClusterManager name="SouthPark Cluster">
              <cluser_nodes>cartman</cluster_nodes>
              <cluser_nodes>kenny</cluster_nodes>
              <cluser_nodes>stan</cluster_nodes>
              <cluser_nodes>kyle</cluster_nodes>
              <cluser_nodes>chef</cluster_nodes>
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/libApplicationDataManager.so</clusterPlugin>
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/libRemoteInputManager.so</clusterPlugin>
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/libStartBarrierPlugin.so</clusterPlugin>
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/libSwapLockTCPPlugin.so</clusterPlugin>
            </ClusterManager>

          On Win32, it would appear as:

            <ClusterManager name="SouthPark Cluster">
              <cluser_nodes>cartman</cluster_nodes>
                  ...
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/ApplicationDataManager.dll</clusterPlugin>
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/RemoteInputManager.dll</clusterPlugin>
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/StartBarrierPlugin.dll</clusterPlugin>
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/SwapLockTCPPlugin.dll</clusterPlugin>
            </ClusterManager>

          On Mac OS X, it would appear as:

            <ClusterManager name="SouthPark Cluster">
              <cluser_nodes>cartman</cluster_nodes>
                  ...
              <clusterPlugin>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/plugins/libApplicationDataManager.dylib</clusterPlugin>

            </ClusterManager>

        * ClusterPlugins have the following functionality:
            * RemoteInputManager
               - Synchronize device data across a cluster
               - Act as a device server for any number of machines.
            * ApplicationDataManager
               - Synchronize arbitrary data structures created in the
                 developers application code across the cluster.
            * StartBarrierPlugin
               - Enforce a strict barrier that will force all nodes to begin
                 calling the vrj::App callback functions at the same time.
            * SwapLockTCPPlugin
               - Provide SwapLock to minimize tearing across multiple displays
                 using TCP/IP socket connection.
            * SwapLockWiredPlugin
               - Provide SwapLock to minimize tearing across multiple displays
                 using a kernel module, a parallel port, and a simple external
                 AND gate.
        * VR Juggler now supports custom simulators which can be created by the
          user to meet their specific needs. Each DrawManager has also been
          given its own "default" simulator.
        * XSLT has been added in:

            $VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/xslt/2.0a1-2.0a2.xsl

          which will provide an easy method to later convert configuration
          files from VR Juggler Alpha1 to a new release.

        * Update to require Boost 1.30


 Version: 2.0 Alpha 1 (1.1.135)
Released: March 15, 2003

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 1.1 DR3):
        * Gadgeteer loads device drivers on demand now.  An InputManager
          chunk must be added to tell the Input Manager what driver(s) to
          load at runtime.  For example, to load the Flock of Birds driver
          and the Immersion IBox driver on a UNIX system, add the following
          to the appropriate configuration file:

            <InputManager name="Input Manager">
              <driver>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/drivers/Flock_drv.so</driver>
              <driver>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/drivers/IBox_drv.so</driver>
            </InputManager>

          On Win32, it would appear as:

            <InputManager name="Input Manager">
              <driver>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/drivers/Flock_drv.dll</driver>
              <driver>${VJ_BASE_DIR}/lib/gadgeteer/drivers/IBox_drv.dll</driver>
            </InputManager>

          All drivers except simulator devices and keyboards must be loaded
          this way on all platforms.  For multiple instances of these, be
          sure to name each <InputManager> block uniquely.
        * In configuration files, all values representing physical units
          (corner positions, translation values, etc.) must be specified in
          meters.
        * All position devices now use a list of filters to transform the
          positional data read from the device.  Correct configuration of
          a device's filter(s) is necessary to inform the Gadgeteer Input
          Manager of what units (feet, inches, meters) the device driver
          returns.
        * gadget::PositionInterface::getData() now returns a copy of a
          gmtl::Matrix44f instead of a pointer to the object.  The method
          also takes an optional argument that tells what measurement units
          the application wants.  The default is feet.

 Version: 1.1 DR3 (1.1.128)
Released: September 29, 2002

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 1.1 DR2):
        * The configuration file format has changed to an XML-based format.
          There is an upgrade path using the cfgupdater script and various
          XSLT stylesheets. Please follow the steps in the Porting Guide
          for further details.

 Version: 1.1.92 (dev build)
Released: April 10, 2002

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 1.1.91):
        * The directory containing miscellaneous data files has been
          renamed from "Data" to "data".

 Version: 1.1.91 (dev build)
Released: October 16, 2001

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from all
    previous versions (including 1.1.x up through 1.1.90):
        * The script juggler-config is now called vrjuggler-config.
        * vjDEBUG has been replaced with vprDEBUG.  The levels and
          categories are now prefixed with "vrj" instead of "vj".  The
          category formerly called vjDBG_ALL is now vprDBG_ALL.

 Version: 1.1.90 (dev build)
Released: September 21, 2001

    Required application changes for upgrading from all previous versions
    (including 1.1.x up through 1.1.89):
        * The directory structure for the source tree has been completely
          reorganized.  All source and header files are now rooted in the
          vrj directory.  The Kernel directory has been separated into
          "Kernel", "Draw", and "Displays".  The Draw directory now contains
          the API-specific application headers in the directories OGL (for
          OpenGL), OSG (for OpenScenegraph), and Pf (for Performer).  In
          addition, the files and classes no longer have the "vj" prefix
          because the vrj namespace has been put into use.  Easy upgrading
          from 1.0 and 1.1.x builds prior to 1.1.90 can be done using the
          compatibility headers in the "deprecated" tree.  Simply add
          -I$(VJ_BASE_DIR)/include/deprecated to your application's makefile
          and recompile.  For a complete upgrade to the new structure and
          naming convention, consult the following web page:

 Version: 1.1 (dev build)
Started: April 13, 2001

    Required application and configuration changes for upgrading from older
    versions:
        * Introduced window viewports.  This means all config files from old
          version are incompatible.  The new chunk type to use is displayWindow.
          The old chunk types (simDisplay & surfaceDisplay) can not be used.
        * vjGlApp::bufferPreDraw() - New interface function for OpenGL-based
          apps.  Must use if going to use multiviewport code.

        * Performer now has some support for run-time reconfiguration.  This
          has the following new implications:
            - numpipes must be set correctly in the display config chunk
            - Sometimes black windows will appear on unused pipes.
        * Performer applications running on Linux must use the pfStat library
          in tools/pfStatLinux otherwise there will be an unresolved symbol
          when running applications.  This is due to a bug in Linux performer.

         <title>Getting Started</title>

         <para>In this book, we present a <quote>how-to</quote> for writing VR
         Juggler applications. We will explain concepts used in VR Juggler and
         present carefully annotated example code whenever appropriate. There
         are two groups of people who should read this book:</para>

               <para>Those who are required to read it in order to do a
               project for work or school. To those in this category, fear
               not—VR Juggler is very simple to use after getting through the
               initial learning stages. It is a powerful tool that will allow
               the creation of interesting and powerful applications very
               quickly.</para>

            <title>Necessary Experience</title>

            <para>To help readers get the most from this book, recommendations
            follow to provide an idea of what previous experience is
            necessary. Various programming skills are needed, of course, but
            programming for VR requires more than just knowledge of a given
            programming language. VR Juggler takes advantage of many
            programming design patterns and advanced concepts to make it more
            powerful, more flexible, and more extensible. A good background in
            mathematics is helpful for performing the myriad transformations
            that must be applied to three-dimensional (3D) geometry.</para>

         <para>In VR Juggler, all applications are written as objects that are

               </indexterm>

               <para>Since VR Juggler applications are objects, developers do
               not write the traditional <function>main()</function> function.
               Instead, developers create an application object that
               implements a set of pre-defined interfaces. The VR Juggler
               kernel controls the application's processing time by calling
               the object's interface implementation methods.</para>

               <para>In traditional programs, the <function>main()</function>
               function defines the point where the <glossterm
               linkend="gloss.thread.of.control">thread of control</glossterm>
               enters the application. After the <function>main()</function>
               function is called, the application starts performing any
               necessary processing. When the operating system (OS) starts the
               program, it gives the <function>main()</function> function some
               unit of processing time. After the time unit (quantum) for the
               process expires, the OS performs what is called a
               <quote>context switch</quote> to change control to another
               process. VR Juggler achieves similar functionality but in a
               slightly different manner.</para>

               <para>The application objects correspond to processes in a
               normal OS. The kernel is the scheduler, and it allocates time
               to an application by invoking the methods of the application
               object. Because the kernel has additional information about the
               resources needed by the applications, it maintains a very
               strict schedule to define when the application is granted
               processing time. This is the basis to maintain coherence across
               the system.</para>

               linkend="figure.vrj.App.hierarchy" /> for a visual
               representation of the complete application interface hierarchy.
               The interface defined in
               <classname>vrj::App</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>vrj::App</secondary>
                  </indexterm> specifies methods for initialization, shutdown,
               and execution of the application. This is the abstract type
               that is seen by the VR Juggler kernel. The Draw Manager
               interfaces specified in the <classname>vrj::*App</classname>
               classes define the API-specific functions necessary to render
               the virtual environment. For example, an interface used by a
               Draw Manager could have functions for drawing the scene and for
               initializing context-specific information.</para>

               <title>Writing an Application Means Filling in the
               Blanks</title>

               <para>To implement an application in VR Juggler, developers
               simply need to <quote>fill in the blanks</quote> of the
               appropriate interfaces. To simplify this process, there are
               default implementations of most methods in the interfaces.
               Hence, the user must only provide implementations for the
               aspects they want to customize. If an implementation is not
               provided in the user application object, the default is used,
               but it is important to know that in most cases, the default
               implementation does nothing.</para>

               <tip>
                  <para>When overriding a virtual method defined by a VR
                  Juggler application class, it is best to call the parent
                  class method implementation before performing any
                  application-specific processing. For example, if a
                  user-defined application object overrides
                  <methodname>vrj::App::init()</methodname> in the class
                  <classname>userApp</classname>, the method
                  <methodname>userApp::init()</methodname> should invoke
                  <methodname>vrj::App::init()</methodname> before performing
                  its own initialization steps.</para>

               <primary>application object</primary>

               <secondary>benefits of</secondary>
            </indexterm>

            <para>As stated earlier, the most common approach for VR
            application development is one where the application defines the
            <function>main()</function> function. That
            <function>main()</function> function in turn calls library
            functions when needed. (This is the model followed by software
            packages such as the <productname>CAVElibs</productname> and the
            Diverse Toolkit.) The library in this model only executes code
            when directed to do so by the application. As a result, the
            application developer is responsible for coordinating the
            execution of the different VR system components. This can lead to
            complex applications.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Allow for Run-Time Changes</title>

               <para>As a <glossterm linkend="gloss.virtual.platform">virtual
               platform</glossterm>, VR Juggler does not use the model
               described above because VR Juggler needs to maintain control of
               the system components. This control is necessary to make
               changes to the virtual platform at run time. As the controller
               of the execution, the kernel always knows the current state of
               the applications, and therefore, it can manage the run-time
               reconfigurations of the virtual environment safely. With
               run-time reconfiguration, it is possible to switch
               applications, start new devices, reconfigure running devices,
               and send reconfiguration information to the application
               object.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Low Coupling</title>

               <para>Application objects lead to a robust architecture as a
               result of low coupling and well-defined inter-object
               dependencies. The application interface defines the only
               communication path between the application and the virtual
               platform, and this allows restriction of inter-object
               dependencies. This decreased coupling allows changes in the
               system to be localized, and thus, changes to one object will
               not affect another unless the interface itself is changed. The
               result is code that is more robust and more extensible.</para>

               <para>Because the application is simply an object, it is
               possibly to load and unload applications dynamically. When the
               virtual platform initializes, it waits for an application to be
               passed to it. When the application is given to the VR Juggler
               kernel at run time, the kernel performs a few initialization
               steps and then executes the application.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Allows Implementation Changes</title>

               <para>Since applications use a distinct interface to
               communicate with the virtual platform, changes to the
               implementation of the virtual platform do not affect the
               application. Changes could include bug fixes, performance
               tuning, or new device support.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Multi-Language Interaction</title>

               <para>By treating applications as objects, we can mix
               programming languages in the VR Juggler kernel. For example, an
               application object could be written in Python, C#, or even
               VB.NET, but the VR Juggler kernel (written in standard C++)
               will still see it as an instance of the abstract interface
               <classname>vrj::App</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>vrj::App</secondary>
                  </indexterm>. The use of application objects has allowed
               such extensions to VR Juggler to be written without requiring
               any changes to VR Juggler.</para>

            <para>In this section, we describe one way to start VR Juggler. We
            will use the traditional <function>main()</function> function in
            C++, but this is not the only way to do it. We have written Python
            applications that start the VR Juggler kernel, and it is possible
            to write a VR Juggler <glossterm
            linkend="gloss.daemon">daemon</glossterm> that loads applications
            on demand at runtime. In other words, the VR Juggler startup
            procedure is quite flexible, and we choose to focus on the
            simplest method here.</para>

               <para>Previously, we explained how VR Juggler applications do
               not have a <function>main()</function> function, but further
               explanation is required. While it is true that user
               <emphasis>applications</emphasis> do not have a
               <function>main()</function> function because they are objects,
               there must still be a <function>main()</function> somewhere
               that starts the system. This is because the operating system
               uses <function>main()</function> as the starting point for all
               applications. In typical VR Juggler applications, there is a
               <function>main()</function>, but it only starts the VR Juggler
               kernel and gives the kernel the application to run. It then
               waits for the kernel to shut down before exiting.</para>

               <para>VR Juggler 2.2 introduces support for Cocoa on Mac OS X.
               Cocoa itself is quite different than the X11 or Win32 APIs as
               far as restrictions on threading and the implementation of the
               <function>main()</function> function. The fundamental issue,
               however, is that both the <classname>NSApplication</classname>
               singleton object and the <classname>vrj::Kernel</classname>
               singleton object want to be in charge of application execution.
               A balance has been struck that generally allows VR Juggler
               applications to look and act the same on Mac OS X as on any
               other platform while still taking advantage of unique features
               that Cocoa and Mac OS X have to offer.</para>

               <section>
                  <title>Application Bundles</title>

                  <para>First and foremost, when using a Cocoa-aware version
                  of VR Juggler, applications have to be constructed as
                  bundles. The details of OS X application bundles are far
                  beyond the scope of this document. However, VR Juggler
                  provides just about everything that is required to make an
                  application bundle. This makes sense because VR Juggler is
                  an application framework that dictates how applications are
                  written and executed. Thus, it also provides the core
                  information required for proper application construction and
                  execution on Mac OS X.</para>

                  <para>To get started, it is helpful to understand what the
                  application bundle will look like when we have everything in
                  place. An application bundle is a directory structure with a
                  special name. For example, <filename>MPApp.app</filename>
                  will show up in the <application>Finder</application> as an
                  application named <quote>MPApp</quote> that can be
                  double-clicked. The name can contain spaces if so
                  desired.</para>

                  <para>Under the base directory is the
                  <filename>Contents</filename> subdirectory. It will contain
                  the files <filename>Info.plist</filename> and
                  <filename>PkgInfo</filename>.</para>

                  <para>Next, there are two subdirectories
                  <filename>MacOS</filename> and
                  <filename>Resources</filename>. Compiled binaries should
                  normally go into the <filename>MacOS</filename>
                  subdirectory. If nothing else, the bundle executable (the
                  compiled application binary) <emphasis>must</emphasis> go in
                  the <filename>MacOS</filename> directory. Shared libraries
                  can go into the <filename>Resources</filename> directory if
                  desired. Generally, though, the
                  <filename>Resources</filename> directory will contain
                  platform-independent data files.</para>

                  <para>In the resources directory, there will be another
                  subdirectory <filename>en.lproj</filename><footnote>
                        <para>This is the English language project data.
                        Translations of <filename>MainMenu.nib</filename>
                        would go into the appropriate language-specific
                        subdirectory.</para>
                     </footnote> which in turn contains
                  <filename>MainMenu.nib</filename> from
                  <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/bundle</filename>.
                  This is a critical part of the application bundle, and it is
                  very important that this NIB behave correctly. The NIB
                  defines the user interface for the VR Juggler application,
                  and what is provided with VR Juggler is set up and ready to
                  go for the most common cases. It is possible to use a
                  different <filename>MainMenu.nib</filename>, but customizing
                  it will require care.</para>

                  <sidebar>
                     <para>The ability to customize the user interface of the
                     VR Juggler application by using a different
                     <filename>MainMenu.nib</filename> and a different
                     application delegate (see <xref
                     linkend="section.custom.delegate" />) makes VR Juggler on
                     Mac OS X unique with respect to other platforms. Whereas
                     the user interface used with <productname
                     class="registered">Microsoft Windows</productname> and
                     the X Window System is essentially hard coded, the Mac OS
                     X Cocoa interface has been designed with flexibility in
                     mind. Simply put, the Cocoa support in VR Juggler
                     leverages the dynamic nature of Cocoa to provide features
                     that are not so easily available on other
                     platforms.</para>

                     <para>The files and directories needed for application

                     The first of these is

                     <literal>@APP_NAME@</literal> strings accordingly for the
                     name of the application being constructed. For the
                     <literal>CFBundleExecutable</literal> property, be sure
                     to change <literal>@APP_NAME@</literal> to be the name of
                     the executable that will be in the Contents/MacOS
                     directory. Other properties to change are those that
                     include copyright and version information.</para>

                     of the file will often be <literal>APPL????</literal>,
                     though other characters are allowed in place of the

                     with the extension <filename>.icns</filename>) is also
                     stored in this directory. A default icon file,
                     <filename>vrjuggler.icns</filename>, can be used, or a

                     <para>For VR Juggler application bundles, a useful file
                     is <filename>vrjuggler.plist</filename>. The default

                     has to do with associating VR Juggler configuration files
                     with application bundles. There are different means by
                     which data can be delivered to applications on Mac OS X.
                     For example, double-clicking on a file in the
                     <application>Finder</application> (or selecting
                     <guimenuitem>Open With</guimenuitem> in the context menu

                     this capability is disabled for the application bundle in
                     question. That is, the application bundle will ignore the
                     <classname>NSApplication</classname> events pertaining to
                     configuration files to be loaded as a result of
                     double-clicking on the said files. Configuration files
                     can still be opened on the fly using the
                     <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu defined in the default NIB

                     VR Juggler application. The interface includes the

                  sample and test applications have a slightly more

                  <para>This approach will not necessarily work on Mac OS X
                  because users normally expect to be able to launch an
                  application by double-clicking on its icon in the
                  <application>Finder</application> and then loading data into
                  it through a GUI. If a user launched the above application
                  that way, the application would exit immediately, and the
                  user would have to open the
                  <application>Console</application> application to find out
                  what went wrong. Launching from the command line, while
                  perfectly valid on Mac OS X, is simply not what users
                  expect. At the same time, remote launching of VR juggler
                  applications in a cluster will almost certainly require
                  launching without the use of the
                  <application>Finder</application> and passing in arguments
                  through <varname>argv</varname>. This is definitely the case
                  when using <ulink

                  <para>If a VR Juggler application will be run on Mac OS X,
                  the programmer has to decide whether command line processing
                  is critical to the execution of the application. There are
                  three options available to VR Juggler programmers on Mac OS
                  X: rely exclusively on command line arguments to launch,
                  handle no command line arguments, or allow the use of
                  command line arguments but do not require them. Given that
                  VR Juggler applications written on all other platforms are
                  highly likely to rely exclusively on command line arguments
                  to launch, the first choice is expected to be the most
                  commonly chosen approach. Nevertheless, we will explain all
                  three.</para>

                     <title>Relying Exclusively on Command Line Arguments to
                     Launch</title>

                     <para>If a VR Juggler application used on Mac OS X will
                     rely solely on command line arguments to launch, it is
                     operating in exactly the same manner as on all other
                     platforms. The <function>main()</function> function can
                     be written as is shown in this document to exit if no
                     command line arguments are supplied. There is still one
                     more thing to do, though. In the
                     <filename>Resources</filename> directory of the
                     application bundle, there must be a property list file in
                     the bundle called
                     <filename>Contents/Resources/vrjuggler.plist</filename>.
                     This property list must have the property
                     <literal>VRJConfigHandling</literal> set to
                     <literal>false</literal>. This is the default setting for
                     this property if the <filename>vrjuggler.plist</filename>
                     file that comes with VR Juggler was used in constructing
                     the application bundle.</para>

                     from a command prompt and pass in the command line
                     arguments. The appropriate event handling will be set up
                     so that the application will behave just as any other Mac
                     OS X application.</para>

                     (i.e., the application is to behave the same as typical

                     <function>main()</function> function shown above needs to
                     change. Specifically, it cannot exit with an error
                     message if no command line arguments are passed in. To
                     keep the application portable, a preprocessor conditional
                     can be used, as shown in <xref
                     linkend="example.cocoa.no.cmd.flags" />. Then, in

               <methodname>updateAllData()</methodname> method call). Because
               the kernel has complete control over the frame, it can make
               changes at pre-defined <quote>safe</quote> times when the
               application is not doing any processing. At these times, the
               kernel can change the virtual platform configuration as long as
               the interface remains the same.</para>

               <para>The frame of execution also serves as a framework for the
               application. That is, the application can expect that when
               <methodname>preFrame()</methodname> is called, the devices have
               just been updated. Applications can rely upon the system being
               in well-defined stages of the frame when the kernel invokes the
               application object's methods.</para>

                  <para>As of VR Juggler 2.0 Alpha 1, applications can specify
                  the units of measure that are the basis for the graphics
                  they render. The default unit of measure is feet (identified

                  <constant>gadget::PositionUnitConversion::ConvertToFeet</constant>)
                  to maintain backwards compatibility with the previous VR
                  Juggler semantics. By overriding this method, applications
                  can identify the unit of measure they expect. The default
                  implementation is the following:</para>

                  <para>Overriding this method means changing the rendering

                  By doing parallel processing in this method, the application
                  can increase its frame rate because drawing and computation

                  buffering. Use of synchronization primitives is not

         <title>Helper Classes</title>

         <para>Within this chapter, we present information on some helper
         classes that are provided for use with VR Juggler. These classes are
         intended to make it easier for application programmers to write their
         code. Ultimately, we want application programmers to focus more on
         compelling immersive content and less on the many details that are
         involved with 3D graphics programming. The classes presented in this
         chapter focus on mathematical computations and on input from hardware
         devices. VR Juggler uses the Graphics Math Template Library or GMTL
         (part of the <ulink url="http://ggt.sf.net/">Generic Graphics
         Toolkit</ulink> software) for mathematical computation. An overview
         of the most commonly used GMTL data types and operations is presented
         here. In addition to the GMTL operations, special attention is paid
         to Gadgeteer, the input system used by VR Juggler, and its device
         interfaces and device proxies.</para>

                     <secondary>gmtl::Vec&lt;S, T&gt;</secondary>
                  </indexterm> is designed to work the same way as a
               mathematical vector, typically of 3 or 4 dimensions. There are
               predefined vector types that would normally be used in a VR
               application that are provided for convenience. That is, a
               <classname>gmtl::Vec3f</classname> object can be thought of as
               a vector of the form &lt;x, y, z&gt;. Similarly, a
               <classname>gmtl::Vec4f</classname> can be thought of as a
               vector of the form &lt;x, y, z, w&gt;. An existing
               understanding of mathematical vectors is sufficient to know how
               these classes can be used. The question then becomes, how are
               they used? We will get to that later, and readers who have
               experience with vectors can skip ahead. If vectors are an
               unfamiliar topic, it may be convenient to think of these
               classes as three- and four-element C++ arrays of
               <type>float</type>s respectively. Most benefits of the vector
               concept are lost with that simpler idea, however. Therefore, if
               the reader needs to think of them as arrays, then arrays should
               probably be used until vectors feel more comfortable. Once the
               use of vectors seems familiar and straightforward, readers are
               encouraged to come back and read further.</para>

               <para>Vectors are typically used to contain spatial data or
               something similar. For convenience, however, they can be
               visualized as a more general-purpose container for numerical
               data upon which well-defined operations can be performed. There
               is no need to constrain thinking of them as only holding the
               coordinates for some point in space or some other limited-scope
               use. The GMTL vectors use by VR Juggler retain this generality
               and can be used wherever vectors come in handy.</para>

               <para>With an understanding of these classes as standard
               mathematical vectors, it is time to learn how to deal with them
               at the C++ level. In some cases, the mathematical operators are
               overloaded to simplify user code; in other cases, a named
               method must be invoked on an object. Before any of that,
               however, make sure that the source file includes the
               <filename>gmtl/Vec.h</filename> header file. From here on, the
               available operations are presented in the order they were

               <para>Before doing anything with vectors, some must be created.
               The examples here use <classname>gmtl::Vec3f</classname>, but
               the example is equally applicable to
               <classname>gmtl::Vec4f</classname>. To create a
               <classname>gmtl::Vec3f</classname>, use the default constructor
               which initializes the vector to &lt;0.0, 0.0, 0.0&gt;:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f vec1;</programlisting>

               <para>After creating the vector <varname>vec1</varname>, its
               elements can be assigned values all at once as follows:</para>

               <programlisting>vec1.set(1.0, 1.5, -1.0);</programlisting>

               <para>or individually:</para>

               <programlisting>vec1[0] = 1.0;
vec1[1] = 1.5;
vec1[2] = -1.0;</programlisting>

               <para>Note that in the last example, the individual elements of
               the vector can be accessed exactly as with a normal array. To
               do the above steps all at once when the vector is created, give
               the element values when declaring the vector:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f vec1(1.0, 1.5, -1.0);</programlisting>

               <para>All of the above code has exactly the same results but
               accomplishes them in different ways. This flexibility is just
               one of the ways that GMTL vectors are more powerful than C++
               arrays (of the same size, of course).</para>

               <para>Normalizing a vector is another simple operation (at the
               interface level anyway). The following code normalizes a
               vector:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f vec1(1.0, 1.5, -1.0);

               <para>The vector <varname>vec1</varname> is now normalized.
               Clean and simple.</para>

               <para>Besides normalizing a given vector, a vector can be
               tested to determine if it has already been normalized. This is
               done as follows (assuming the vector <varname>vec</varname> has
               already been declared before this point):</para>

               </indexterm>

               <para>Part of normalizing a vector requires finding its length
               first. To get a vector's length, do the following:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f vec1(1.0, 1.5, -1.0);
float length;

length = gmtl::length( vec1 );</programlisting>

               <para>In this case, length is assigned the value 2.061553 (or
               more accurately, the square root of 4.25). Finding the length
               of a vector appears simple from the programmer's perspective,
               but it has some hidden costs. Namely, it requires a square root
               calculation. For optimization purposes, GMTL provides a
               function called <function>gmtl::lengthSquared()</function> that
               returns the length of the vector without calculating the square
               root.</para>

               <para>The GMTL vector classes provide an easy way to multiply a
               vector by a scalar. There are several ways to do it depending
               on what is required. Examples of each method follow.</para>

               <para>To multiply a vector by a scalar and store the result in
               another vector, do the following:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f vec1(1.0, 1.5, -1.0), vec2;

vec2 = 3 * vec1;</programlisting>

               <para>(The order of the factors in the multiplication can be
               swapped depending on preference or need.) Here,
               <varname>vec2</varname> gets the value &lt;3.0, 4.5,
               -3.0&gt;.</para>

               <para>To multiply a vector by a scalar and store the result in
               the same vector, do the following:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f vec1(1.0, 1.5, -1.0);

vec1 *= 3;</programlisting>

               <para>After this, <varname>vec1</varname> has the value
               &lt;3.0, 4.5, -3.0&gt;.</para>

               <para>Very similar to multiplying by a scalar, division by

               identical, they are provided here for clarity.</para>

               <para>To divide a vector by a scalar and store the result in

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f vec1(1.0, 1.5, -1.0), vec2;

vec2 = vec1 / 3;</programlisting>

               <para>Here, <varname>vec2</varname> gets the value
               &lt;0.333333, 0.5, -0.333333&gt;. Note that the scalar must
               come after the vector because the operation would not make
               sense otherwise.</para>

               <para>To divide a vector by a scalar and store the result in

vec1 /= 3;</programlisting>

               <para>After this, <varname>vec1</varname> has the value

               <para>The details behind <classname>gmtl::Vec3f</classname> and
               <classname>gmtl::Vec4f</classname> really are not all that
               gory. Internally, they are represented as three- and
               four-element arrays of <type>float</type>s respectively. Access
               to these arrays is provided through the member function
               <methodname>getData()</methodname>. For example, this access
               can be used in the following way:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f pos(4.0, 1.0982, 10.1241);

glVertex3fv(pos.getData());</programlisting>

               <para>Granted, this particular example is rather silly and much
               slower than just listing the values as the individual arguments
               to <function>glVertex3f()</function>, but it should get the
               point across.</para>

               <para>In general, the <methodname>getData()</methodname> member
               function should be treated very carefully. Access to it is
               provided mainly so that operations similar to this example can
               be performed quickly. An example of abusing access to
               <methodname>getData()</methodname> follows:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec4f my_vec;

my_vec.getData()[0] = 4.0;
my_vec.getData()[1] = 1.0982;
my_vec.getData()[2] = 10.1241;
my_vec.getData()[3] = 1.0;</programlisting>

               <para>Do not do this. It can be confusing to readers of the
               code who do not necessarily need to know the details of the
               internal representation. Instead, use one of the methods
               described above for creating vectors and assigning the elements
               values.</para>

            in the interfaces for the class are provided. It concludes with a

                  </indexterm> represents a 4×4 matrix of single-precision
               floating-point values. The class includes implementations of
               the standard matrix operations such as transpose, scale, and
               multiply. More specifically, it is a mechanism to facilitate
               common matrix operations used in computer graphics, especially
               those associated with a <emphasis>transform</emphasis> matrix.
               On the surface, it is nearly identical to a 4×4 C++ array of
               <type>float</type>s, but there is one crucial difference: a
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname> keeps its internal
               matrix in column-major order rather than in row-major
               order<indexterm>

                     <secondary>compared to C++ matrices</secondary>
                  </indexterm>. More detail on this is given below, but this
               is done because OpenGL maintains its internal matrices using
               the same memory layout. At the conceptual level, this does not
               matter—it is related only to the matrix representation in the
               computer's memory. Access to the elements is still in row-major
               order. In any case, understanding how C++ multidimensional
               arrays work means understanding 90% of what there is to know
               about <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname>. The class
               provides a degree convenience not found with a normal C++
               array, especially when programming with OpenGL. The
               complications surrounding the
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname> class are identical to
               those with OpenGL matrix handling, and with an understanding of

               <para>What is presented here involves some complicated concepts
               that are far beyond the scope of this documentation. Without an
               understanding of matrix math (linear algebra) and an
               understanding of how transformation matrices work in OpenGL,
               this document will not be very useful. It is highly recommended
               that readers be familiar with these topics before proceeding.
               Otherwise, with this high-level description in mind, we now

               <para>Keeping the idea of a normal mathematical matrix in mind,
               we are now ready to look at the C++ use of the
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname> class. Most of the
               interface is defined using methods, but there are a few cases
               where mathematical operators have been overloaded to make code
               easier to read. Before going any further, whenever using a
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname>, make sure to include
               <filename>gmtl/Matrix.h</filename> first. The operations
               presented above are now described in detail in the order in
               which they were listed above. We begin with creating the
               objects and setting their values.</para>

               <para>Before doing anything with matrices, some must be created
               first. To create a <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname>, the

               be an identity matrix:</para>

               <para>After creating this matrix <varname>mat1</varname>, its
               16 elements can be assigned values all at once as
               follows:</para>

               <programlisting>mat1.set(0.0, 1.0, 2.3, 4.1,

         3.8, 0.9, 2.1, 0.1);</programlisting>

   2.3, 2.2, 9.7, 2.1,
   4.1, 1.0, 1.0, 0.1

mat1.set(mat_vals);</programlisting>

               <para>Note that when explicitly listing the values with
               <methodname>set()</methodname>, they are specified in
               <emphasis>row-major</emphasis> order. When put into a
               16-element array of <type>float</type>s, however, they must be
               ordered so that they can be copied into the
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname> in
               <emphasis>column-major</emphasis> order. This is the one
               exception in the interface where access is column-major (which
               probably means that the interface has a bug).</para>

               <para>To set all the values of a new matrix in one step, they

               <para>All of the above code has exactly the same results but

               <para>To read the elements in a

               use either the overloaded [] operator or the overloaded ()
               operator. The overloaded [] operator returns the specified row
               of the <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname>, and an element
               in that row can then be read using [] again. The code looks
               exactly the same as with a normal C++ two-dimensional
               array:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Matrix44f mat1(0.0, 1.0, 2.3, 4.1,

               <para>Here, <varname>val</varname> is assigned the value 3.8.
               Using the overloaded () operator results in code that looks
               similar to the way the matrix element would be referenced in
               mathematics:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Matrix44f mat1(0.0, 1.0, 2.3, 4.1,

               <para>In computer graphics, an identity matrix is often needed
               when performing transformations. Because of this,
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname> provides a method for
               converting a matrix into an identity matrix in a single step
               (at the user code level anyway):</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Matrix44f mat1(0.0, 1.0, 2.3, 4.1, 8.3, 9.0, 2.2, 1.0,
                     5.6, 9.9, 9.7, 8.2, 3.8, 0.9, 2.1, 0.1);

gmtl::identity(mat1);</programlisting>

               <para>Of course, simply declaring <varname>mat1</varname> with
               no arguments would achieve the same result, but that is not
               such an interesting example.</para>

               <para>Before using a matrix, it is often helpful to zero it out
               to ensure that there is no pollution from previous use. With a
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname>, this can be done in one
               step:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Matrix44f mat1(0.0, 1.0, 2.3, 4.1, 8.3, 9.0, 2.2, 1.0,
                     5.6, 9.9, 9.7, 8.2, 3.8, 0.9, 2.1, 0.1);

gmtl::zero(mat1);</programlisting>

               <para>The result is that all elements of
               <varname>mat1</varname> are now 0.0.</para>

               </indexterm>

               <para>All the rotation information for a transform can be
               contained in a single matrix using the methods for making an
               XYZ, a ZYX, or a ZXY Euler matrix. Code for all three
               follows:</para>

               <programlisting>vrj::Matrix mat1;
float x_rot = 0.4, y_rot = 0.541, z_rot = 0.14221;

gmtl::setRot(mat1, gmtl::EulerAngleXYZf(x_rot, y_rot, z_rot));
gmtl::setRot(mat1, gmtl::EulerAngleZYXf(z_rot, y_rot, x_rot));
gmtl::setRot(mat1, gmtl::EulerAngleZXYf(z_rot, x_rot, y_rot));</programlisting>

               <para>In every case, the matrix is zeroed before the rotation
               transformation is stored. The result of the above code is that
               <varname>mat1</varname> is a ZXY Euler rotation matrix. The
               previous two operations are destroyed.</para>

               </indexterm>

               <para>To make a translation matrix, there are two methods with
               each having two different types of arguments specifying the
               translation. The first makes a matrix with only the given
               translation (all other transformation information is
               destroyed):</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Matrix44f mat;
gmtl::Vec3f trans(4.0, -4.231, 1.0);

mat = gmtl::makeTrans&lt;gmtl::Matrix44f&gt;(trans);</programlisting>

               <para>To <emphasis>change</emphasis> the translation of a
               transformation matrix without completely obliterating all other
               transformations, use the following instead:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f trans(4.0, -4.231, 1.0);

gmtl::setTrans(mat, trans);</programlisting>

               <para>To make a transformation matrix that only scales, a
               simple method is provided. It works as follows:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Matrix44f mat;
gmtl::Vec3f scale( 1.5, 1.5, 1.5 );

mat = gmtl::makeScale&lt;Matrix44f&gt;(scale);</programlisting>

               <para>The result is that mat is a transformation matrix that
               will perform a scale operation. In this specific case, the
               scaling happens uniformly for x, y, and z.</para>

               </indexterm>

               <para>Finally, methods are provided for extracting
               transformations from a given matrix. The individual rotations
               and the translation can be read. For the following examples,
               assume that <varname>mat</varname> is a
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname> object representing
               arbitrary translation, rotation, and scaling transformations.
               To get the Z-axis rotation information (an Euler angle), use
               the following:</para>

               <programlisting>float z_rot = (gmtl::makeRot&lt;gmtl::EulerAngleXYZf&gt;(mat))[2];</programlisting>

               <para>The value return is in radians. We can also get the
               X-axis rotation.</para>

               <programlisting>float x_rot = (gmtl::makeRot&lt;gmtl::EulerAngleXYZf&gt;(mat))[0];</programlisting>

               <para>Getting translations is even simpler because translations
               are collected into a single vector easily.</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Vec3f trans;
gmtl::setTrans(trans, mat);</programlisting>

               <para>After this, the translation in <varname>mat</varname> is
               stored in trans. The same can be done with a
               <classname>gmtl::Vec4f</classname> instead of the
               <classname>gmtl::Vec3f</classname>.</para>

               <para>SGI's OpenGL Performer likes to work with its own
               <classname>pfMatrix</classname> class, and to facilitate the
               use of it with <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname>, two
               conversion functions are provided for making conversions. The
               first works as follows:</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Matrix44f vj_mat;
pfMatrix pf_mat;

// Perform operations on vj_mat...

pf_mat = vrj::GetPfMatrix(vj_mat);</programlisting>

               <para>where <varname>vj_mat</varname> is passed by reference
               for efficiency. (<varname>pf_mat</varname> gets a copy of a
               <classname>pfMatrix</classname> which is a slow operation.) To
               convert a <classname>pfMatrix</classname> to a
               <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname>, do the
               following:</para>

               <programlisting>pfMatrix pf_mat;
gmtl::Matrix44f vj_mat;

// Perform operations on pf_mat...

vj_mat = vrj::GetVjMatrix(pf_mat);</programlisting>

               <para>Here again, <varname>pf_mat</varname> is passed by
               reference for efficiency, and <varname>vj_mat</varname> gets a
               copy of a <classname>gmtl::Matrix44f</classname>. Both of these
               functions are found in the header
               <filename>vrj/Draw/Pf/PfUtil.h</filename>.</para>

               <para>OpenGL ordering specifies that the matrix has to be

               <function>glMultMatrixf()</function>), the

            application and an input device. The application makes requests on
            the input device through the proxy.</para>

            <para>Proxies are acquired through the Gadgeteer Input Manager,
            but the process is not entirely straightforward. To assist with
            the use of device proxies, Gadgeteer provides what are called
            <glossterm linkend="gloss.device.interface">device
            interfaces</glossterm>. Device interfaces hide the details of
            proxy acquisition through the Input Manager, but the concept of
            device interfaces is something that often causes confusion for
            those new to VR Juggler application programming. Two
            object-oriented design patterns are combined by device interfaces:
            smart pointers and proxies. Within this section, we aim to explain
            Gadgeteer device proxies and device interfaces clearly and simply.
            We begin with high-level descriptions of both and then move on to
            their use in VR Juggler application objects.</para>

               <para>As noted above, access to input device data is granted
               through device proxies allocated by the Gadgeteer Input
               Manager. For each type of input device (digital, analog,
               keyboard/mouse, etc.), there is a device proxy class. As a
               programmer of VR Juggler applications, knowledge of such
               proxies does not have to be terribly in-depth. The fact is,
               most VR Juggler application object programmers will probably
               never need to know more about the interface of a type-specific
               device proxy than the return type of its data request method
               (usually named <methodname>getData()</methodname>). We will see
               more about the data request method in the explanation of device
               interfaces below. Most of the perceived complexity in the
               type-specific proxy classes is only important to Gadgeteer's
               internal maintenance of the active proxies. The following is
               the complete list of proxy classes in Gadgeteer 1.0 (used by VR
               Juggler 2.0):</para>

               use the higher level device interface as the mechanism to
               acquire a proxy and read data from the proxied device. The
               device interface encapsulates some type of proxy that in turn
               points to an input device. That device can be a wand, a
               keyboard, a light sensor, or a home-brewed device that reads
               some input and returns it to Gadgeteer in a meaningful way.
               That is a lot of indirection, but it makes the handling of
               physical devices by Gadgeteer incredibly powerful.</para>

               acquisition of proxies. Thus, typical VR Juggler application

               <para>In the application object, a device interface member
               variable is used as a <glossterm

               pointer</glossterm><indexterm>
                     <primary>smart pointer</primary>
                  </indexterm> to the proxy. In C++, a smart pointer is not
               usually an actual object pointer. Instead, the class acting as
               a smart pointer overloads the dereference operator -&gt; so
               that a special action can be taken when the
               <quote>pointer</quote> is dereferenced. The dereference
               operator is just another operator like the addition and
               subtraction operators, and overloading the deference operator
               allows some extra work to be done behind the scenes. On the
               surface, the code looks exactly the same as a normal pointer
               dereference, and in most cases, people reading and writing the
               code can think of the smart pointer as a standard pointer. It
               may also be convenient to think of a smart pointer as a
               handle.</para>

               <para>With that background, we can move on to explain how
               <classname>gadget::DeviceInterface&lt;T&gt;</classname> uses
               these concepts. In user code, there will be instances of types
               such as
               <classname>gadget::DigitalInterface</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>gadget::DigitalInterface</secondary>
                  </indexterm>,

                     <secondary>gadget::PositionInterface</secondary>
                  </indexterm>,
               <classname>gadget::KeyboardMouseInterface</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>gadget::KeyboardMouseInterface</secondary>
                  </indexterm>, and the like. Once they are properly
               initialized, device interface objects (whatever their types may
               be) will act as smart pointers to the actual Gadgeteer device
               proxy objects that they encapsulate.</para>

               <para>At this point, it is perfectly reasonable to wonder why
               Gadgeteer uses a concept that requires all sorts of
               documentation and explanation. The extra effort is worth it
               because it allows Gadgeteer to hide the actual type of the
               device being used. There is no need to know that some specific
               VR system uses a wireless mouse connected to a PC reading bytes
               from a PS/2 port that represent button presses. All that
               matters is knowing which buttons are pressed at a given
               instant. The class
               <classname>gadget::DigialInterface</classname> gives exactly
               that information, and it quietly hides the messiness of dealing
               with the mouse, its driver, and its communication
               protocol.</para>

               <title>Using Device Interfaces</title>

               <para>Before using a device interface, some objects must be
               declared. Programmers must choose the type that is appropriate
               for the type of devices relevant to a given application. All
               device interface objects must be initialized in the application
               object's override of the method
               <methodname>vrj::App::init()</methodname> method<indexterm>
                     <primary>device interfaces</primary>

                     <secondary>initialization of</secondary>
                  </indexterm>. Because we are dealing with a templated type
               (<classname>gadget::DeviceInterface&lt;T&gt;</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>gadget::DeviceInterface&lt;T&gt;</secondary>
                  </indexterm>), every type-specific instantiation has the
               same interface. Hence, all type-specific device interfaces are
               initialized using the
               <methodname>gadget::DeviceInterface&lt;T&gt;::init()</methodname>
               method. This method takes a single string argument naming the
               proxy to which the interface will connect. The name can be the
               name of a proxy or a proxy alias, both of which are defined in
               VR Juggler configuration files. Example names are
               <quote>VJHead</quote>, <quote>Wand</quote>,
               <quote>VJButton0</quote>, and <quote>Accelerate
               Button</quote><indexterm>
                     <primary>device aliases</primary>

                     <secondary>examples of</secondary>
                  </indexterm>. Using meaningful symbolic names makes them
               easier to remember, and it also contributes to hiding the
               details about the physical device. With this system, no one
               needs to care how transformation information from the user's
               head is generated. Gadgeteer cares, but there is no need for it
               to tell anyone else. All developers care about is the head
               transformation matrix. An example of initializing a
               <classname>gadget::PositionInterface</classname> that connects
               with the user head proxy is:</para>

               <programlisting>gadget::PositionInterface head;

head.init("VJHead");</programlisting>

               <para>Remember that this has to be done in an application
               object's <methodname>init()</methodname> method. The actual
               object used would be a member variable of the application
               class. Note that here, the normal syntax for calling the method
               of a C++ object is used rather than using the dereference
               operator. Until it is initialized, the device interface object
               cannot act as a smart pointer.</para>

               <para>Once device interface objects are all initialized and
               ready to use, it is time to start using them as smart
               pointers<indexterm>

                  </indexterm>. VR Juggler and Gadgeteer are already working
               hard in the background to update device proxies, and the
               application is free to access them. It is usually best to
               acquire data from the device proxy through the device interface
               in the <methodname>preFrame()</methodname> method, but this may
               not necessarily be true for all proxies. Continuing with our
               example of a <classname>gadget::PositionInterface</classname>
               to the user head proxy, the following code shows how to read
               the transformation matrix for the user's head (in feet):</para>

               <programlisting>gmtl::Matrix44f head_mat = head-&gt;getData();</programlisting>

               <para>Believe it or not, the code really is that easy. Simply
               use the overloaded dereference operator to get access to the
               position proxy object hidden in
               <classname>gadget::PositionInterface</classname> to read data
               from the proxy. We now move on to explain the use of
               type-specific device interfaces.</para>

                  <title>Using
                  <classname>gadget::AnalogInterface</classname></title>

                  <para>Analog devices return floating-point data. As noted
                  above, the return type of
                  <methodname>gadget::AnalogProxy::getData()</methodname> is
                  <type>float</type>. Behind the scenes, analog devices in
                  Gadgeteer scale their input so that application objects

                  <para>Command-oriented devices were introduced in Gadgeteer
                  1.0 Beta 1. They are an evolving device type geared towards
                  complex input that can be interpreted at an abstract level.
                  In Gadgeteer 1.0, such input comes in the form of spoken
                  phrases that are reinterpreted as commands identified by
                  unique integer values. In future versions of Gadgeteer, this
                  device type will be used for scalable gesture recognition.
                  The return type of
                  <methodname>gadget::CommandProxy::getData()</methodname> is
                  <type>int</type>, and it is up to the person configuring the
                  command-oriented device to set up the command-to-integer

                  returns the current state of such a device as a value of the

                  type is defined to allow for easy on/off testing, but it

               can be replaced without shutting down and restarting the
               application. To support this capability, proxies can become
               <quote>stupefied,</quote> which means that they are not
               connected to a device and cannot return new data.</para>

               <para>In general, application programmers do not need to worry
               about stupefied proxies. Data will be returned by the proxy
               whether it is stupefied or not, but if the proxy is stupefied,
               it cannot return <emphasis>new</emphasis> data. Stupefied
               proxies can occur as a result of an error in the VR Juggler
               configuration or because the hardware device pointed at by the
               proxy failed to start up correctly.</para>

               <para>To determine whether a proxy is stupefied, the method
               <methodname>gadget::Proxy::isStupefied()</methodname> can be
               used. The stupefied state cannot be changed programatically by
               user code, however. Only the Input Manager is capable of
               reconfiguring a proxy to point at a new valid device. Hence,
               changing the stupefication state of a proxy from an application
               object will have no effect and may cause the application to
               crash.</para>

               <warning>
                  <para>In all versions of VR Juggler prior to 2.0 Beta 3, the
                  word <quote>stupefied</quote> was misspelled as
                  <quote>stupified.</quote> The method
                  <methodname>gadget::Proxy::isStupified()</methodname> is
                  retained in Gadgeteer 1.0 for backwards compatibility, but
                  it will be removed in Gadgeteer 1.2 (which will ship as part
                  of VR Juggler 2.2).</para>

               <para>What is truly amazing about Gadgeteer device interfaces
               is, despite their seeming complexity, there is really nothing
               to them. Trying to trace through the source code is a little
               tricky, but conceptually, it is all about pointers. Keep in
               mind that all this documentation was written using nothing more
               than the Gadgeteer header files as a reference.</para>

                     <secondary>gadget::DeviceInterface&lt;T&gt;</secondary>
                  </indexterm> provides the method interface for all the
               type-specific instantiations, including the overloaded
               dereference operator. The base class of

               <classname>gadget::BaseDeviceInterface</classname><indexterm>

               reference itself, and it provides the all-important
               <methodname>init()</methodname> method.</para>

               <para>The beauty of it all is that the proxy object being
               pointed to by the device interface can be changed without
               affecting the execution of the user application. In other
               words, the proxies can be changed at run time to point to
               different <emphasis>physical</emphasis> devices. All the while,
               the user code is still using the smart pointer interface and
               getting data of some sort. This flexibility is one of the most
               important features of Gadgeteer, and it is important to
               understand.</para>

            <title>Application Review</title>

            <para>Before getting into too much detail, we present this section
            as a review from earlier chapters. There is no new information
            here; it is simply a quick overview of the basics of VR Juggler
            applications.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Basic Application Information</title>

               <para>As described in previous chapters (see <xref
               linkend="chapter.getting.started" />, for example), all VR
               Juggler applications derive from a base application object
               class (<classname>vrj::App</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>vrj::App</secondary>
                  </indexterm>). This class defines the basic interface that
               VR Juggler expects from all application objects. This means
               that when constructing an application, the user-defined
               application object must inherit from
               <classname>vrj::App</classname> or from a Draw Manager-specific
               application class that has <classname>vrj::App</classname> as a
               superclass. For example:</para>

               <programlisting>class userApp : public vrj::App
{
public:
   init();
   preFrame();
   postFrame();
}</programlisting>

               <para>This defines a new application class
               (<classname>userApp</classname>), instances of which can be
               used anywhere that VR Juggler expects an application
               object.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Draw Manager-Specific Application Classes</title>

               <para>A user application does not have to (and in most cases
               does not) derive from <classname>vrj::App</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>vrj::App</secondary>
                  </indexterm> directly. In almost all cases, an application
               class is derived from a Draw Manager-specific application
               class. For example:</para>

               <programlisting>class userGlApp : public vrj::GlApp
{
public:
   init();
   preFrame();
   postFrame();
   
   draw();
}</programlisting>

               <para>This is an example of an OpenGL application. The
               application class (<classname>userGlApp</classname>) has
               derived directly from the OpenGL Draw Manager-specific
               <classname>vrj::GlApp</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>vrj::GlApp</secondary>
                  </indexterm> application base class. This class provides

            </indexterm>

            <para>There are many types of input devices that VR Juggler
            application objects can use including positional, digital, and
            analog<indexterm>
                  <primary>input device types</primary>
               </indexterm>. All application objects share the same processes
            and concepts for acquiring input from devices. The main thing to
            remember about getting input in applications is that all VR
            Juggler applications receive input through device proxies managed
            by
            <classname>gadget::DeviceInterface&lt;T&gt;</classname><indexterm>
                  <primary>classes</primary>

                  <secondary>gadget::DeviceInterface&lt;T&gt;</secondary>
               </indexterm> instantiations. There are
            <classname>gadget::DeviceInterface&lt;T&gt;</classname>
            instantiations for each type of input data that Gadgeteer can
            handle. There is one for positional input, one for analog, and so
            on. In this section, we will only demonstrate the use of position
            and digital device interfaces. Refer to <xref
            linkend="section.gadget.proxies.devif" /> for more detailed
            information on the use of all the available device
            interfaces.</para>

            <section>
               <title>How to Get Input</title>

               <para>While there has already been a brief presentation about
               getting input in an application, we need something more. Since
               all device interfaces look the same, we will focus on an
               example of getting positional input. All other types are very
               similar. We begin with a simple application object
               skeleton.</para>

               <programlisting>class myApp : public vrj::App
{
public:
   init();
   preFrame();
private:
   gadget::PositionInterface mWand;
}</programlisting>

               <para>Note the declaration of the variable
               <varname>mWand</varname> of type
               <classname>gadget::PositionInterface</classname>. This is the
               first addition to an application. Device interfaces are usually
               member variables of the user application class, as in this
               example.</para>

               <programlisting>myApp::init()
{
   mWand.init("NameOfPosDevInConfiguration");
}</programlisting>

               <para>The device interface has to be told about the device from
               which it will get data. This is done by calling the device
               interface object's <methodname>init()</methodname> method with
               the symbolic string name of the device. This device name comes
               from the active configuration. We are now ready to read from
               the device.</para>

               <programlisting>...
const float units = getDrawScaleFactor();
gmtl::Matrix44f wand_pos(mWand-&gt;getData(units));
...</programlisting>

               <para>The above code shows an example of using the positional
               device interface in an application. It shows some sample code
               where the application copies the positional information from a
               device interface. When it is dereferenced, the device interface
               figures out what device it points to and returns the data from
               that device. Again, refer to <xref
               linkend="section.gadget.proxies.devif" /> for more information
               about using device proxies and device interfaces.</para>

               </indexterm>

               <para>In the previous section, we showed how to get input from
               devices, but we never said where to put the code. The location,
               surprisingly, is application dependent. There are some very
               good guidelines regarding where applications should process
               input. Before explaining them, however, we should review the VR
               Juggler kernel control loop, presented again in <xref
               linkend="figure.kernel.loop.sequence2" />.</para>

               <figure id="figure.kernel.loop.sequence2">
                  <title>VR Juggler kernel control loop</title>

                     </imageobject>
                  </mediaobject>
               </figure>

               <para>This diagram looks complicated, but the key here is the
               <methodname>updateAllData()</methodname> call near the bottom
               of the diagram. This is where the Gadgeteer Input Manager
               updates all the cached device data that will be used in drawing
               the next frame. This updated copy is used by all user
               references to device data until the next update and the end of
               the next frame of execution.</para>

               <para>This means two things:</para>

               <orderedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>The device data is most fresh in
                     <methodname>vrj::App::preFrame()</methodname>, and</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>Any time spent in
                     <methodname>vrj::App::preFrame()</methodname> increases
                     the overall system latency.</para>
                  </listitem>
               </orderedlist>

               <para>The first point is important because it means that the
               copy of the device data with the lowest latency is always
               available in the <methodname>preFrame()</methodname> member
               function. The second point is equally important because it says
               why user applications should not waste any time in
               <methodname>preFrame()</methodname>. Any time spent in
               <methodname>preFrame()</methodname> increases system latency
               and in turn decreases the perceived quality of the environment.
               Hence, it is crucial to avoid placing computations in
               <methodname>preFrame()</methodname>.</para>

         <para>This chapter comprises the bulk of information about
         application development. This makes sense when one considers the
         importance of computer grahpics in the context of immersive
         applications. In each section of this chapter, we explain the use of
         different graphics application programming interfaces (APIs) within
         the scope of VR Juggler. While the sections of this chapter are tied
         to specific APIs, we highly recommend that all prospective
         programmers of VR Juggler applications read the first section about
         OpenGL applications. This section covers core fundamentals of the VR
         Juggler OpenGL Draw Manager that apply to the use of Open Scene Graph
         and OpenSG with VR Juggler.</para>

            <para>We can now describe how to write OpenGL applications in VR

            section, <classname>vrj::App</classname> defines the base
            interface that VR Juggler expects of all applications. The
            <classname>vrj::GlApp</classname> class extends this interface by
            adding members that the VR Juggler OpenGL Draw Manager needs to
            render an OpenGL application correctly.</para>

            data</glossterm> (do not worry what context data is right now—we
            cover that in detail later). There are a few other member
            functions in the interface, but these cover 99% of the issues that
            most developers face. In the following sections, we will describe
            how to add OpenGL drawing to an application and how to handle
            context-specific data. There is a tutorial for each topic.</para>

               <para>Before describing how to render using OpenGL with VR
               Juggler, we must cover the more basic topic of clearing the
               color and depth buffers. We describe this part before
               explaining how to render graphics because these steps will be
               common to all VR Juggler applications based on OpenGL.</para>

               <para>In VR Juggler 1.1 and beyond, there is support for
               drawing multiple OpenGL viewports in a single VR Juggler
               display window. This feature is useful for tiled displays where
               each viewport renders a specific part of the scene. In order
               for an OpenGL-based application to work with multiple
               viewports, the color and depth buffers need to be cleared at
               the correct times.</para>

               <para>In a user application, the method
               <methodname>vrj::GlApp::bufferPreDraw()</methodname> is
               overridden so that it clears the color buffer. For example, the
               following code clears the color buffer using black:</para>

               <programlisting>void userApp::bufferPreDraw()
{
   glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
   glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
}</programlisting>

               <para>Now we need to clear the depth buffer. This must be done
               separately from the color buffer to ensure proper stereo
               rendering. The depth buffer must be cleared in the application
               object's <methodname>draw()</methodname> method, usually as the
               first step:</para>

               <programlisting>void userApp::draw()
{
   glClear(GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

   // Rendering the scene ...
}</programlisting>

               <para>The most important (and visible) component of most OpenGL
               applications is the OpenGL drawing. The
               <classname>vrj::GlApp</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>vrj::GlApp</secondary>
                  </indexterm> class interface defines a
               <methodname>draw()</methodname> member function to hold the
               code for drawing a virtual environment. Hence, any OpenGL
               drawing calls should be placed in the
               <methodname>vrj::GlApp::draw()</methodname> function of the
               user application object.</para>

               <para>Adding drawing code to an OpenGL-based VR Juggler
               application is straightforward. The
               <methodname>draw()</methodname> method is called whenever the
               OpenGL Draw Manager needs to render a view of the virtual world
               created by the user's application. It is called for each
               defined OpenGL context, and it may be called multiple times per
               frame in the case of multi-surface setups and/or stereo
               configurations. Applications should <emphasis>never</emphasis>
               rely upon the number of times this member function is called
               per frame.</para>

               <para>When the method is called, the OpenGL model view and
               projection matrices have been configured correctly to draw the
               scene. Input devices are guaranteed to be in the same state
               (position, value, etc.) for each call to the
               <methodname>draw()</methodname> method for a given
               frame.</para>

                  <title>Recommended Uses</title>

                  <para>The only code that should execute in this function is
                  calls to OpenGL drawing routines. It is permissible to read
                  from input devices to determine what to draw, but
                  application data members should not be updated in this
                  function.</para>

               linkend="gloss.csdata">context-specific data</glossterm> within
               OpenGL, and we proceed to explain how it is used by VR Juggler.

               <para>The OpenGL graphics API operates using a state machine
               that tracks the current settings and attributes set by the
               OpenGL code. Each window in which we render using OpenGL has a
               state machine associated with it. The state machines associated
               with these windows are referred to as <glossterm

               <para>Each context stores the current state of an OpenGL

                  <title>Why it is Needed</title>

                  <para>As outlined in the VR Juggler architecture
                  documentation, VR Juggler uses a single memory area for all
                  application data. All threads can see the same memory area
                  and thus share the same copy of all variables. This makes
                  programming normal application code very easy because
                  programmers never have to worry about which thread can see
                  which variables. In the case of context-specific data,
                  however, it presents a problem.</para>

                  <para>To understand the problem, consider an environment
                  where we use a single display list. That display list is
                  created to draw some object in the scene. We would like to
                  be able to call the display list in our
                  <methodname>draw()</methodname> method and have it draw the
                  primitives that were captured in it.</para>

                  <para>The following class skeleton shows an outline of this
                  idea. Do not worry for now that we do not show the code
                  where we allocate the display list—that will be covered
                  later. For now, we see that there is a variable that stores
                  the display list ID (<varname>mDispListId</varname>), and we
                  use it in the <methodname>draw()</methodname> method.</para>

                  <programlisting>using namespace vrj;

class userApp : public GlApp
{
public:
  draw();
public:
  int mDispListId;
};

userApp::draw()
{
   glCallList(mDispListId);
}</programlisting>

                  <para>Now, imagine that we have a VR system configured that
                  needs more than one display window (a multi-wall projection
                  system, for example). There is a thread for each display,
                  and all the display threads call
                  <methodname>draw()</methodname> in parallel.</para>

                  <para>Since all threads share the same copy of the
                  variables, they all use the same
                  <varname>mDispListId</varname> when calling
                  <function>glCallList()</function>. This is an error because
                  we call draw from multiple windows (that is, multiple OpenGL
                  rendering contexts). The display list ID is not the same in
                  each context. What we need, then, is a way to use a
                  different display list ID depending upon the OpenGL context
                  within which we are currently rendering. Context-specific
                  data comes to the rescue to address this problem.</para>

                  <para>Context-specific data provides us with a way to get a
                  separate copy of a variable for each OpenGL rendering
                  context. This may sound daunting at first, but VR Juggler
                  manages this special variable so that it appears just as a
                  normal variable. The developer never has to deal with
                  contexts directly. VR Juggler transparently ensures that the
                  correct copy of the variable is being used.</para>

                  </indexterm>

                  <para>The following shows how a context-specific variable
                  appears in a VR Juggler application:</para>

                  <programlisting>using namespace vrj;

class userApp : public GlApp
{
public:
   draw();
public:
   GlContextData&lt;int&gt; mDispListId; // Context-specific variable
};

userApp::draw()
{
   glCallList(*mDispListId);
}</programlisting>

                  <para>This code looks nearly the same as the previous
                  example. In this case, <varname>mDispListId</varname> is
                  treated as a pointer, and it has a special template-based
                  type that tells VR Juggler it is context-specific data. When
                  defining a context-specific data member, use the
                  <classname>vrj::GlContextData&lt;T&gt;</classname><indexterm>
                        <primary>classes</primary>

                        <secondary>vrj::GlContextData&lt;T&gt;</secondary>
                     </indexterm> template class and pass the
                  <quote>true</quote> type of the variable to the template
                  definition. From then on, it can be treated as a normal
                  pointer.</para>

                  <note>
                     <para>The types that are used for context-specific data
                     must provide default constructors. The user cannot
                     directly call the constructor for the data item because
                     VR Juggler has to allocate new items on the fly as new
                     contexts are created.</para>

                  <title>The Inner Workings of Context-Specific
                  Variables</title>

                  <para>Curious readers are probably wondering how all of this
                  works. To satisfy any curiosity, we now provide a brief
                  description.</para>

                  <para>The context data items are allocated using a
                  template-based smart pointer class
                  (<classname>vrj::GlContextData&lt;T&gt;</classname><indexterm>
                        <primary>classes</primary>

                        <secondary>vrj::GlContextData&lt;T&gt;</secondary>
                     </indexterm>). Behind the scenes, VR Juggler keeps a list
                  of currently allocated variables for each context. When the
                  application wants to use a context data item, the smart
                  pointer looks in the list and returns a reference to the
                  correct copy for the current context.</para>

                  <para>This is all done in a fairly light-weight manner. It
                  all boils down to one memory lookup and a couple of pointer
                  dereferences. Not bad for all the power that it
                  gives.</para>

               <para>The VR Juggler OpenGL graphics system is a complex,
               multi-headed beast. Luckily, developers do not have to
               understand how the system is working to use it correctly. As
               long as developers subscribe to several simple rules for
               allocating and using context data, everything will work fine.
               This section contains these rules, but it does not describe the
               rationale behind the rules. Those readers who are interested in
               the details of why these rules should be followed should please
               read the subsequent section. It contains much more
               (excruciating) detail.</para>

                  on to how and where the context-specific data should be
                  allocated. If we want to create a display list, we need to

                     <para>This is straightforward: do not allocate context
                     data in the <methodname>draw()</methodname> member
                     function. There are many reasons for this, but the
                     primary one is that allocation tests would be occurring
                     too many times and at incorrect times. There are better
                     places to allocate context data.</para>

                     context data refers to context data that does not change
                     during the application's execution. An example of static
                     context data would be a display list to render an object
                     model that is preloaded by the application and never
                     changes. It is static because the display list only has
                     to be generated once for each context, and the
                     application can generate the display list as soon as it
                     starts execution.</para>

                     <para>The <methodname>contextInit()</methodname> member
                     function is called immediately after creation of any
                     <emphasis>new</emphasis> OpenGL contexts. In other words,
                     it is called whenever new windows open. When it is
                     called, the newly created context is active. This method
                     is the perfect place to allocate static context data
                     because it is only called when we have a new context that
                     we need to prepare (and also because that is what it is
                     designed for).</para>

                     <para>The following code snippet shows a possible use of
                     the application object's
                     <methodname>contextInit()</methodname> method:</para>

                     <para>This shows the normal way that display lists should

                     store it to a context-specific data member, and then fill
                     the display list. Texture objects and other types of
                     context-specific data are created in exactly the same

                           <primary>vrj::GlApp</primary>

                     context data differs from static context data in that
                     dynamic data may change during the application's
                     execution. An example of dynamic data would be a display
                     list for rendering an object from a data set that changes
                     as the applications executes. This requires dynamic
                     context data because the display list has to be
                     regenerated every time the application changes the data
                     set.</para>

                     <para>Consider also the following example. While running
                     an application, the user requests to load a new model
                     from a file. After the model data is loaded, it may be
                     best to put the drawing functions into a fresh display
                     list for rendering the model. In this case,
                     <methodname>vrj::GlApp::contextInit()</methodname> cannot
                     be used because it is only called when a new context is
                     created. Here, all the windows have already been created.
                     What we need, then, is a <glossterm
                     linkend="gloss.callback">callback</glossterm> that is
                     called once per existing context so that we can add and
                     change the context-specific data. That is what
                     <methodname>contextPreDraw()</methodname> does. It is
                     called once per context for each VR Juggler frame with
                     the current context active.</para>

                     <para>Please notice, however, that since this method is
                     called often and is called in performance-critical areas,
                     you should not do much work in it. Any time taken by this
                     method directly decreases the draw performance of the
                     application. In most cases, we recommend trying to make
                     the function have a very simple early exit clause such as
                     in the following example. This makes the average cost
                     only that of a single comparison operation.</para>

                  <para>Rule 1 says that context-specific data should not be
                  allocated in an application object's
                  <methodname>draw()</methodname> method. We have already
                  stated that the main reason is that
                  <methodname>draw()</methodname> is called too many times,
                  and it is called at the wrong time for allocation of
                  context-specific data. To be more specific, the
                  <methodname>draw()</methodname> method is called for each
                  surface, or for each eye, every frame. Static
                  context-specific data only needs to be allocated when a new
                  window is opened. (Dynamic context-specific data is handled
                  separately.)</para>

                  application that will use context-specific data. This is an
                  extension of the simple OpenGL application presented in
                  <xref linkend="section.simple.opengl.app" />. Note the

            <para>Programmers familiar with the use of scene graphs may prefer
            to use that data structure rather than writing OpenGL manually.
            While VR Juggler does not provide a scene graph of its own, its
            design allows the use of existing scene graph software. In VR
            Juggler 1.1 and beyond, the supported scene graphs are OpenGL
            Performer from SGI, OpenSG, and Open Scene Graph. This section
            explains how to use OpenGL Performer to write VR Juggler
            applications.</para>

            <classname>vrj::PfApp</classname> derives from
            <classname>vrj::App</classname>. <classname>vrj::PfApp</classname>
            extends <classname>vrj::App</classname> by adding methods that
            deal with scene graph initialization and access. <xref
            linkend="figure.vrj.PfApp2" /> shows how
            <classname>vrj::PfApp</classname> fits into the class hierarchy of
            a Performer-based VR Juggler application.</para>

            initialize the application scene graph and to get the root of the
            scene graph respectively. They must be implemented by the
            application (they are pure virtual methods within
            <classname>vrj::PfApp</classname>). Additional methods will be
            discussed in this section, but in many cases the default
            implementations of these other methods may be used. A simple
            tutorial application will be provided to illustrate the concepts
            presented.</para>

               <para>In an application using OpenGL Performer, the scene graph
               must be initialized before it can be used. The method
               <methodname>vrj::PfApp::initScene()</methodname> is provided
               for that purpose. Within this method, the root of the
               application scene graph should be created, and any required
               models should be loaded and attached to the root in some way.
               The exact mechanisms for accomplishing this will vary depending
               on what the application will do.</para>

               <para>During the initialization of OpenGL Performer by VR
               Juggler, <methodname>vrj::PfApp::initScene()</methodname> is

               <function>pfInit()</function> and

               <para>In order for Performer to render the application scene
               graph, it must get access to the scene graph root. The method
               <methodname>vrj::PfApp::getScene()</methodname> will be called
               by the Performer Draw Manager so that it can give the scene
               graph root node to Performer. Since the job of
               <methodname>getScene()</methodname> is straightforward, its
               implementation can be very simple. A typical implementation
               will have a single statement that returns a member variable
               that holds a pointer to the application scene graph root
               node.</para>

               <title><function>pfExit()</function>: To Call or Not to
               Call</title>

               <para>The Performer function <function>pfExit()</function>
               poses a problem for VR Juggler applications, and some
               background information will help ensure that readers understand
               the consequences of using <function>pfExit()</function> (or
               not). The main issue with <function>pfExit()</function> as it
               relates to VR Juggler is that calling
               <function>pfExit()</function> has the side effect of calling
               the system function <function>exit()</function>, which means
               that it should be (or has to be) the very last function call of
               a program. Prior to VR Juggler 2.0.1, the VR Juggler Performer
               Draw Manager was written to call <function>pfExit()</function>
               from within the method
               <methodname>vrj::PfDrawManager::closeAPI()</methodname>. Before
               VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 3, however, this method of the
               <classname>vrj::PfDrawManager</classname> interface had never
               been called—the result of the kernel shutdown process being
               incomplete. With the more complete kernel shutdown process in
               VR Juggler 2.0 Beta 3 and 2.0.0, authors of Performer-based VR
               Juggler applications saw their applications exiting prematurely
               after invoking the kernel shutdown. More specifically, any code
               that was intended to be executed after
               <methodname>vrj::PfDrawManager::closeAPI()</methodname> would
               not be executed. Such code includes
               <methodname>vrj::App::exit()</methodname> or an override
               thereof; an application object destructor; and anything else to
               be done after
               <methodname>vrj::Kernel::waitForKernelStop()</methodname>
               returned.</para>

               <para>To remedy this problem,
               <methodname>vrj::PfDrawManager::closeAPI()</methodname> in VR
               Juggler 2.0.1 and newer <emphasis>does not</emphasis> call
               <function>pfExit()</function>. Rather, it is the responsibility
               of the application programmer to call
               <function>pfExit()</function> if s/he so desires. Failing to
               call <function>pfExit()</function> could result in resource
               leaks from Performer, but calling <function>pfExit()</function>
               has been known to cause application crashes (irrespective of
               whether VR Juggler is used). In general, users should call
               <function>pfExit()</function> at the end of their
               <function>main()</function> function, but if doing so causes
               the application to crash on exit, then not calling
               <function>pfExit()</function> is probably the better
               option.</para>

               <sidebar>
                  <para>Resources that could be leaked by Performer if
                  <function>pfExit()</function> is not called would generally
                  fall under the heading of <quote>temporary files.</quote>
                  Resource leaks are not memory leaks since the operating
                  system will automatically deallocate any memory held by
                  Performer at the time of application exit. Since Performer
                  may allocate temporary files for its process locking and
                  shared memory arena, it would usually be best to ensure that
                  Performer cleans up after itself.</para>
               </sidebar>

               <para>The important thing to remember is that the application
               object destructor needs to be called
               <emphasis>before</emphasis> <function>pfExit()</function> is
               called. Refer to <xref linkend="example.using.pfExit.heap" />

            wrapper to initialize the application scene graph and to get the
            root of the scene graph respectively. They must be implemented by
            the application (they are pure virtual methods within
            <classname>vrj::OpenSGApp</classname>). The rest of this section
            gives a more detailed description of these methods and some sample
            code to illustrate the concepts presented.</para>

               <para>In an application using OpenSG, the scene graph must be
               initialized before it can be used. The method
               <methodname>vrj::OpenSGApp::initScene()</methodname> is
               provided for that purpose. Within this method, the root of the
               application scene graph should be created, and any required
               models should be loaded and attached to the root in some way.
               The exact mechanisms for accomplishing this will vary depending
               on what the application will do.</para>

               <para>During the API initialization,
               <methodname>vrj::OpenSGApp::initScene()</methodname> is
               invoked. This happens after
               <methodname>OSG::osgInit()</methodname> has been called, so
               OpenSG should be fully initialized and ready to be used.</para>

               <para>In order for OpenSG to render the application scene
               graph, it must get access to the scene graph root. The method
               <methodname>vrj::OpenSGApp::getScene()</methodname> will be
               called by the OpenSG application class wrapper so that it can
               get access to the currently active scene graph whenever the
               wrapper needs to use it (for example when rendering or
               updating). Since the job of <methodname>getScene()</methodname>
               is straightforward, its implementation can be very simple. A
               typical implementation will have a single statement that
               returns a member variable that holds a pointer to the current
               scene graph root node.</para>

               <para>In an application using OSG, the scene graph must be
               initialized before it can be used. The method
               <methodname>vrj::OsgApp::initScene()</methodname> is provided
               for that purpose. Within this method, the root of the
               application scene graph should be created, and any required
               models should be loaded and attached to the root in some way.
               The exact mechanisms for accomplishing this will vary depending
               on what the application will do.</para>

               <para>In order for OSG to render the application scene graph,
               it must get access to the scene graph root. The method
               <methodname>vrj::OsgApp::getScene()</methodname> will be called
               by the OSG application class wrapper so that it can get access
               to the currently active scene graph whenever the wrapper needs
               to use it (for example when rendering or updating). Since the
               job of <methodname>getScene()</methodname> is straightforward,
               its implementation can be very simple. A typical implementation
               will have a single statement that returns a member variable
               that holds a pointer to the current scene graph root
               node.</para>

                  minimum amount of processing necessary to return the root
                  scene graph node. In most cases, this method should only be
                  one line of code. See the following code for an

            <para>Traditionally, multi-screen immersive systems have relied
            upon dedicated high-end shared memory graphics workstations or
            supercomputers to generate interactive virtual environments. These
            multi-screen immersive systems typically require one or two video
            outputs for each screen and simultaneously utilize several
            interaction devices. In recent years this trend of almost
            exclusively using high-end systems has started to change as
            commodity hardware has become a viable alternative to high-end
            systems.</para>

            <para>Current technologies have empowered PC-based systems with
            high-quality graphics hardware, significant amount of memory and
            computing power, as well as support for many external devices.
            Their application to virtual reality applications is motivated by
            the dramatic cost decrease they represent and by the wide range of
            options and availability. To drive a multi-screen immersive
            environment we need multiple commodity systems working as a single
            unit, that is, a tightly synchronized <indexterm>
                  <primary>cluster</primary>
               </indexterm>cluster. The challenge is that, although the base
            technology is standard off-the-shelf technology, there is a lack
            of software for weaving together the cluster into a platform that
            supports the creation of virtual environments. Furthermore, there
            is an even greater lack of software that can allow existing
            virtual environment designed for high-end system to transparently
            migrate to a cluster.</para>

            <para>In this section, we review the clustering capabilities of VR
            Juggler 2.0. The current implementation of clustering in VR
            Juggler is the result of the hard work of many people and of
            several design and implementation iterations. It is the most
            important new feature in VR Juggler 2.0, and it is also the most
            complex new feature internally. At the level of the application
            object, the clustering infrastructure is largely hidden. Those
            pieces that are exposed have been designed to be easy to use and
            to work in non-cluster configurations. This aids in application
            portability between VR system configurations.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Shared Input Data</title>

               <para>One approach to implementing clustering for interactive
               graphics applications is to share all data received from input
               devices. This is based on an assumption that the interaction
               with the computer graphics will occur through input devices
               such as 6DOF trackers, pointing devices, etc. Using this
               approach, a distinct copy of the VR application is run on each
               cluster node, but they all see the same input data. Since
               changes to the scene are based on information from the input
               devices, all the nodes will make the same state changes each
               frame and therefore remain synchronized.</para>

               <para>This capability is implemented through the Gadgeteer
               Remote Input Manager and the <literal>RIMPlugin</literal> used
               by the Cluster Manager. The basic goal of these components is
               to provide a distributed shared memory system for VR input
               device data. Through shared input data, applications can
               migrate transparently between shared memory VR systems and PC
               cluster VR systems.</para>

               <para>Shared input data is the easiest VR Juggler clustering
               feature that can be utilized by application object programmers.
               In simple cases, nothing about an application will have to
               change to take advantage of shared input data because the
               details are hidden within the VR Juggler configuration. The
               Cluster Manager simply needs to be configured to load the
               <literal>RIMPlugin</literal> and the Start Barrier Plug-in
               (<literal>StartBarrierPlugin</literal>) to enable applications
               to take advantage of shared input data.</para>
            </section>

            <section id="section.cluster.UserData">
               <title>Application-Specific Shared Data</title>

               <para>When input data sharing is not sufficient to enable a VR
               Juggler application to run on a cluster, the next option is to
               use application-specific shared data. Using this option, VR
               application developers can easily exchange any type of data
               across a cluster of machines. For example, we might have a GUI
               running on a hand-held device that interacts with the VR
               application to control it. We cannot expect this GUI to connect
               to all nodes in the cluster. Instead, the GUI connects to a
               single node that accepts the commands from the GUI and then
               relays them to the rest of the cluster nodes using
               application-specific shared data.</para>

               <para>Application-specific shared data is implemented through
               the generic (templated) container type
               <classname>cluster::UserData&lt;T&gt;</classname><indexterm>
                     <primary>cluster::UserData&lt;T&gt;</primary>

                     <primary>classes</primary>

                     <secondary>cluster::UserData&lt;T&gt;</secondary>
                  </indexterm> and the Application Data Manager plug-in
               (<literal>ApplicationDataManager</literal> in the Cluster
               Manager config element plug-in list). As is typically the case
               with generic containers, any sort of data can be stored and
               therefore shared. The only caveat is that the contained type
               must have the following two methods:</para>

               <note>
                  <para>Since the return type of these two methods is

               <para>Deriving from

               a pointer to a

                     <secondary>vpr::ObjectWriter</secondary>
                  </indexterm> object. An object writer is a simple wrapper
               around an expandable block of memory. Each write operation
               appends some number of bytes to the memory block based on the
               size of the data written. The type
               <classname>vpr::ObjectWriter</classname> provides methods for
               writing all the basic C++ data types (<type>int</type>,
               <type>float</type>, <type>bool</type>, <type>char</type>,
               etc.), though they are named based on the cross-platform type
               identifiers provided by the VR Juggler Portable Runtime
               (<type>vpr::Int32</type>, <type>vpr::Uint8</type>, etc.). Byte
               ordering (endian) issues are handled internally by the object
               writer. The implementation of
               <methodname>writeObject()</methodname> for any shared data type
               simply copies the data members of the shared data structure
               into the object writer.</para>

               <para>Inversely, the implementation of
               <methodname>readObject()</methodname> reads data from an object
               reader (an instance of
               <classname>vpr::ObjectReader</classname><indexterm>

                     <secondary>vpr::ObjectReader</secondary>
                  </indexterm>) into the local copy of the data structure. The
               object reader contains a fixed-size block of memory and a
               pointer to the current location in that memory block. Each read
               operation moves the pointer some number of bytes in the memory
               block based on the size of the data read.</para>

               <important>
                  <para>Due to the symmetric nature of
                  <methodname>writeObject()</methodname> and
                  <methodname>readObject()</methodname>, the reading and
                  writing of data must occur in the same order. That is, the
                  implementation of <methodname>writeObject()</methodname>
                  will write the shared data in some order, and
                  <methodname>readObject()</methodname> must read the shared
                  data back out in the same order.</para>
               </important>

               <para>We now present two examples of using the serializable
               object concept. The first demonstrates the case when a new data
               structure can be created; the second is the case when a
               third-party type must be made serializable. When we make a new
               data structure, it is quite easy to enable serialization.
               Consider the basic type shown in <xref
               linkend="example.declare.serializable.type" />. It derives from
               <classname>vpr::SerializableObject</classname> and overrides
               <methodname>writeObject()</methodname> and
               <methodname>readObject()</methodname> just as it must. It has
               three data members of different types that define the state of
               an instance of our type. The serialization and de-serialization
               implementation, which is quite straightforward, is shown in
               <xref linkend="example.implement.serialization" />.</para>

               <para>Now we consider the case when we need to serialize a
               third-party type. First, let us assume that we have a type,
               called <classname>SomeType</classname>, defined in a header
               file from a third-party C++ library. This is shown in <xref
               linkend="example.type.SomeData" />. The type has three accessor
               methods for reading its data and three for writing. We can then
               specialize the methods of
               <classname>vpr::SerializableObjectMixin&lt;T&gt;</classname> as
               shown in <xref linkend="example.serialize.SomeData" />.</para>

               <para>The magic of

               allows the specialized methods to behave as member functions in
               <classname>SomeType</classname>. This means that the
               specialized members have easy access to all public and
               protected members of <classname>SomeType</classname>.</para>

               <para>Now that we have data serialization out of the way, we
               can turn our attention to the use of
               <classname>cluster::UserData&lt;T&gt;</classname>, the special
               type that automates application-specific data sharing. For each
               type of shared data, the application object will have at least
               one instance of
               <classname>cluster::UserData&lt;T&gt;</classname>. Example

               </example>

               <para>Next, we must initialize the
               <classname>cluster::UserData&lt;T&gt;</classname> instances so
               that the Application Data Manager plug-in can identify the
               shared data types and so that the application can determine
               which cluster node will be allowed to write to the shared data.
               While there are two ways to do this, we will show only the
               recommended approach here. First, a globally unique identifier
               (GUID) must be defined for each and every shared data type
               instance. The command-line utility <command>uuidgen</command>
               is available on most operating systems for generating new GUIDs
               (also known as universally unique identifiers or UUIDs). These
               will be used in the application object
               <methodname>init()</methodname> method, as shown in <xref
               linkend="example.init.cluster.UserData" />.</para>

   vpr::GUID sometype_guid("A154B8E8-32AB-11D9-B4C9-000D933B5E6A");
   mSomeTypeObj.init(sometype_guid);
}</programlisting>
               </example>

               <important>
                  <para>Do not use the member function
                  <methodname>vpr::GUID::generate()</methodname> to initialize
                  the type-specific GUID objects. This will result in every
                  cluster node always having a different GUID value every time
                  the application is run (because GUIDs are unique by
                  definition). If this happens, the Application Data Manager
                  plug-in will never be able to complete its initialization,
                  and the application frame loop will not be able to start on
                  all the cluster nodes.</para>
               </important>

               <para>In conjunction with this, two config elements need to be
               created. These will be used by the Application Data Manager
               plug-in to identify which cluster node will be the writer node.
               The <quote>guid</quote> properties must match the string values

               <caution>
                  <para>Be very careful to ensure that the GUID strings match

                  <quote>guid</quote> property with the use in the application
                  code. If the GUID strings are not matched correctly, the

               <para>Now that the shared data is initialized and ready to use,
               we can write to and read from it—the Application Data Manager
               plug-in will take care of the rest. Only one node can be

               <para>After the snapshot of the application-specific shared
               data for the current frame has been distributed to the cluster
               nodes, it is time to read the shared data and set up the
               application state for rendering the current frame. This should
               be done in the application object method
               <methodname>latePreFrame()</methodname> or in

               <para>The choice of which method to use depends on the
               application type and on the data flow of the application
               object. Scene graph-based application objects will not have a
               <methodname>draw()</methodname> method, so
               <methodname>latePreFrame()</methodname> must be used. For
               application object types not based on a scene graph (currently
               only <classname>vrj::GlApp</classname>), there is a trade off
               to consider. If <methodname>latePreFrame()</methodname> is
               used, then the rendering state information must be stored in
               member variables of the application class. If
               <methodname>draw()</methodname> is used, then the state can be
               defined using stack variables within the method, but the
               additional function call overhead and pointer derference
               (resulting from the use of the Smart Pointer pattern) could
               impact the application frame rate. Remember that
               <methodname>draw()</methodname> is invoked for every window and
               every viewport within each window. The number of calls to
               <methodname>draw()</methodname> increases further when
               stereoscopic rendering is enabled. If
               <methodname>latePreFrame()</methodname> is used instead, the
               Smart Pointer overhead will only be exhibited once per
               frame.</para>

                  <para>Using time as input to algorithms is a very common
                  occurrence in VR applications. On a cluster, however, each
                  node has its own clock, and each node may start its frame
                  loop at a slightly different time than the other cluster
                  nodes. Differences such as these would result in
                  inconsistencies among the time-based computations across the
                  cluster nodes.</para>

                  <para>These problems can be avoided through a feature of the
                  input data sharing feature of VR Juggler's cluster support.
                  Every time a Gadgeteer device driver takes a sample from the
                  input device, a time stamp is applied to the sample. This
                  time stamp is included with the shared device data and can
                  be accessed through the device interfaces used by the
                  application objects. A time delta since the last frame can
                  then be calculated. Use of this is demonstrated in <xref

                  </indexterm>

                  <para>Random numbers are, by definition, random. When two
                  computers generate a random number, there is a high
                  likelihood that they will generate different numbers.
                  However, the algorithms used to generate random numbers on
                  computers generate <emphasis>pseudo-random</emphasis>
                  numbers. Pseudo-random numbers are generated by algorithms
                  that have a predictable nature. Given a known starting point
                  (called a <firstterm>seed</firstterm>), the sequence of
                  numbers generated can be predicted. If the same algorithm is
                  seeded identically on two separate computers, the two
                  sequences of generated random numbers will be identical.
                  Varying the seed allows the algorithms to generate different
                  random sequences</para>

                  <para>This is a very important issue for VR application
                  programming in a cluster configuration. When an application
                  object uses random numbers, each application instance across
                  the cluster must generate the same sequence of random
                  numbers. With VR Juggler, there are two options for making
                  this happen. The first is to seed the random number
                  generator algorithm identically on all the cluster nodes.
                  This is an easy solution as long as all the nodes use the
                  same algorithm to generate random numbers. If the seed is
                  hard coded into the application object initialization, the
                  random number sequence will always be the same for every run
                  of the application. While the numbers will still be random,
                  the predictable nature of pseudo-random number generators
                  could become a detriment.</para>

                  <para>The second option is to use application-specific
                  shared data, as described above in <xref
                  linkend="section.cluster.UserData" />. In this case, only
                  one node will generate the random numbers, and the
                  Application Data Manager will take care of sharing the most
                  recently generated number(s) with the other nodes. Using
                  this approach allows for better algorithm seeding and thus
                  better random number generation. It also avoids the issue of
                  different computers having different random number generator
                  algorithms.</para>

                           out across three processors. Unfortunately, this

            <para>Immersive applications often take advantage of sound to
            enhance suspension of disbelief. VR Juggler application
            programmers have many options available to them for adding sound
            to their virtual environments. In this section, we describe the
            library Sonix that ships with VR Juggler. Sonix provides a layer
            of abstraction for third-party audio libraries including <ulink

            In VR Juggler 2.0, there is one Sound Manager implemented using
            Sonix. As such, Sonix is the easiest tool to use for adding sound
            to VR Juggler applications, but it is not the only option.</para>

               <title>Using Sonix Directly</title>

               <para>We begin our explanation of adding sound to a VR Juggler
               application by presenting the direct use of the Sonix API. This
               requires more programming than using the VR Juggler Sound
               Manager, but it will be useful to understand how Sonix operates
               in order to take full advantage of the Sound Manager. In
               particular, reading this section is a necessary part of
               understanding general Sonix usage, and readers are encouraged
               to read both this section and the next before deciding on which
               approach to use in their VR Juggler applications.</para>

                  <title>Basic Sonix Usage</title>

                  <para>In <xref linkend="figure.sonix.interface" />, we see
                  the API for Sonix (see <xref
                  linkend="figure.complete.sonix.design" /> for the complete
                  software architecture). The main parts that a sound
                  programmer will use are the classes
                  <classname>snx::SoundHandle</classname> and
                  <classname>snx::sonix</classname> (a singleton). The
                  <classname>snx::SoundHandle</classname> class is used to
                  manipulate individual sounds. The
                  <classname>snx::sonix</classname> singleton class is used to
                  start, stop, and reconfigure the sound system. Both classes
                  must be used for any sound to be heard.</para>

                  <para>Starting the Sonix system is easy. Basically, the only
                  call needed to start the system is
                  <methodname>snx::sonix::changeAPI()</methodname>. The
                  backend audio software is loaded into Sonix through a
                  plug-in system. The plug-in to use is identified by a string
                  name, one of <quote>OpenAL</quote>,
                  <quote>AudioWorks</quote>, or <quote>Audiere</quote>, as
                  shown in <xref linkend="example.sonix.OpenAL" />. The choice
                  of which to use depends on availability and compatibility.
                  For example, AudioWorks is available on the IRIX operating
                  system, but it can only be used with a build of VR Juggler
                  that uses SPROC threads. On the other hand, OpenAL and
                  Audiere on IRIX can only be used with a pthreads build of VR
                  Juggler.</para>

                  instance of <classname>snx::SoundInfo</classname> to
                  configure the sound object, which is in turn accessed by an
                  instance of <classname>snx::SoundHandle</classname>.</para>

                  <para>Periodically, an update function must be called to
                  keep Sonix running. The method is snx::sonix::step(), and it
                  takes a single argument of type <type>float</type>
                  representing the time since the last time it was called. In
                  general, this should be invoked in the frame function of an
                  application. In the context of VR Juggler, this would be
                  either <methodname>preFrame()</methodname> or

                  <para>Sonix is reconfigurable, allowing audio APIs to be
                  swapped out at run time safely without the dependent systems
                  noticing. Applications using Sonix expect to be completely
                  portable. Changing sound APIs at run time can be useful so
                  that the user can experiment with quality and latency
                  differences of different hardware and sound APIs. If no
                  audio API is available on a given platform, calls to Sonix
                  simply are ignored. This means that applications do not have
                  to have special code to enable or disable sounds based on
                  the availability of the backend sound software. These
                  details are handled transparently by Sonix.</para>

                  <para>Before we conclude this section on using Sonix
                  directly in applications, we examine the design details of
                  Sonix. These details are beyond the scope of what needs to
                  be understood in order for Sonix to be utilized by VR
                  Juggler applications, so readers not interested in these

                  <para>Sonix was designed using modern software design
                  principles including design patterns and object oriented

                  <xref linkend="figure.complete.sonix.design" />. As
                  evidenced by the diagram, the design of Sonix is quite
                  simple, though the classes tend to have relatively large
                  interfaces. Refer to the Sonix <emphasis>Programmer

                           <classname>snx::SoundHandle</classname> is how users
                           manipulate their sound object.
                           <classname>snx::SoundHandle</classname> is actually
                           a proxy to a <classname>std::string</classname>
                           proxy. The <classname>std::string</classname> Proxy
                           is what allows Sonix reconfiguration of resources.
                           Rather than using pointers which can easily be left
                           to dangle, the <classname>std::string</classname>
                           serves as a lookup for a protected sound resource
                           located internally to the Sonix run-time memory
                           space. The <classname>snx::SoundHandle</classname>
                           wraps this <classname>std::string</classname> to
                           provide a simple and familiar C++ object to use as
                           the sound handle. The Sonix class acts as Mediator
                           between every Proxy method and the actual audio
                           system Adapter.</para>

                     Each plug-in implements an adapter to an underlying audio
                     subsystem. The adapter supports a common interface that
                     Sonix knows how talk to. Each adapter is then registered
                     with a factory object, which may ask that adapter to

               <title>Using the VR Juggler Sound Manager</title>

               <para>Now that we understand how Sonix works and how to use its
               simple API, we can go one step further and simplify the usage
               even more. Similar to the graphics API-specific VR Juggler Draw
               Managers, there exists the concept of a Sound Manager. There is
               a Sonix-specific Sound Manager implementation that handles many
               of the details of Sonix usage.</para>

               <para>The Sonix Sound Manager is configured using a config
               element of type <literal>sound_manager_sonix</literal>. The
               config element sets the sound API to use, defines the llistener
               position, and sets up all the sound objects that will be used
               by the application. All of this would normally have to be done
               by the application programmer using the
               <classname>snx::sonix</classname> singleton, as presented above
               in <xref linkend="section.basic.sonix.usage" />. In <xref
               linkend="example.config.sonix.sound.manager" />, we show a
               small example of configuring the Sonix Sound Manager. Note that
               some parts of the config file are removed for brevity. Aspects
               of this will be referenced in the code examples shown
               below.</para>

               <para>All sound files named in the config element are
               automatically loaded by the Sonix Sound Manager. User
               applications simply declare sound handles that refer to the
               loaded sound objects. The VR Juggler application class will
               then include one <classname>snx::SoundHandle</classname>
               instance for each sound object declared in the Sonix Sound
               Manager config element, as shown in <xref
               linkend="example.app.declaring.sound.handles" />. This is very
               similar to the use of Gadgeteer device interfaces that provide
               access to device input.</para>

               <example id="example.app.declaring.sound.handles">
                  <title>Declaring Sound Handles in Application Object
                  Class</title>

                  <programlisting>class MySoundApp : public vrj::GlApp
{
public:
   void init();
   void preFrame();
   // Other application object interface methods ...

private:
   // Determines if the "bump" sound should be triggered.
   bool shouldTriggerBump();

   // Determines if the "step" sound should be triggered.
   bool shouldTriggerStep();

   snx::SoundHandle mBumpSound;
   snx::SoundHandle mStepSound;
   // And so on ...
};</programlisting>
               </example>

               <para>To get access to the sounds through the
               <classname>snx::SoundHandle</classname> objects, the sound
               handles must be initialized. This is done in the same way as
               described earlier in the explanation of direct use of the Sonix
               API. The sound handle initialization should be performed in the
               <methodname>init()</methodname> method of the VR Juggler
               application object, as shown in <xref
               linkend="example.app.init.sound.handles" />. The string value
               passed to <methodname>snx::SoundHandle::init()</methodname> is
               the name given in the Sonix Sound Manager config element.
               Again, we see similarity with the usage of Gadgeteer device
               interfaces.</para>

               <example id="example.app.init.sound.handles">
                  <title>Initializing Sound Handles in an Application
                  Object</title>

                  <programlisting>void MySoundApp::init()
{
   mBumpSound.init("bump");
   mStepSound.init("step");
   // And so on ...
}</programlisting>
               </example>

               <para>Finally, the sounds can be triggered in the application
               object <methodname>preFrame()</methodname> method, shown below
               in <xref linkend="example.app.trigger.sound" />. They should
               not be triggered in the <methodname>draw()</methodname> method
               because, as we have seen in earlier sections,
               <methodname>draw()</methodname> can be invoked multiple times
               per frame. There is no need to call the function
               <methodname>snx::sonix::step()</methodname> in
               <methodname>preFrame()</methodname> or in
               <methodname>postFrame()</methodname>. This is done
               automatically within the Sonix Sound Manager each time through
               the kernel control loop.</para>

         application written with the <productname>CAVElibs</productname>
         software to VR Juggler. We explain the process for an OpenGL
         application. Throughout, we compare and contrast the techniques used
         by VR Juggler and the <productname>CAVElibs</productname> software,
         and we translate concepts familiar to

            <title>The Initialize, Draw, and Frame Routines</title>

            <para>In the <productname>CAVElibs</productname>, the initialize,
            draw, and frame routines are known as <glossterm
            linkend="gloss.callback">callbacks</glossterm> implemented with C
            function pointers. In VR juggler, the equivalent routines are
            <quote>called back</quote> using an application object. An
            application object is a C++ class that defines methods to
            encapsulate the functionality of the application within a single
            C++ object.</para>

            <bridgehead>In <productname>CAVElibs</productname></bridgehead>

            <para>The following lists the draw, frame, and initialize routines
            used in the <productname>CAVElibs</productname> software.</para>

            <bridgehead>In VR Juggler</bridgehead>

            <para>With VR Juggler, no C function pointers are necessary, but a
            pointer to an application object must be given to the VR Juggler
            kernel. As described in earlier sections of this chapter, the
            first step is to derive a new application class from
            <classname>vrj::GlApp</classname>. For more information on
            application objects, it may be helpful to review <xref
            linkend="chapter.app.basics" />. Briefly, the application class
            definition would appear similar to the following:</para>

            <programlisting>class MyApplication : public vrj::GlApp
{
   ...
};</programlisting>

            <para>The draw, frame, and initialize routine concepts in VR
            Juggler are presented in the following list.</para>

                  function is defined by a member function called
                  <methodname>draw()</methodname> in the derived class. This
                  is where OpenGL rendering commands such as
                  <function>glBegin()</function>,
                  <function>glVertex()</function>, etc. are placed.</para>

            <title>Configuration</title>

            <para>Configuration of VR Juggler and the
            <productname>CAVElibs</productname> software is very different.
            The differences are too numerous to list here, but we give a brief
            overview and a pointer to the documentation that explains
            configuration of VR Juggler.</para>

            <bridgehead>In <productname>CAVElibs</productname></bridgehead>

            <para>All configurable parameters go in a single file called
            <filename>.caverc</filename>. The configuration mechanism is
            proprietary and not usable by external VR system software. In
            particular, VR Juggler cannot get its configuration information
            from an existing <filename>.caverc</filename> file.</para>

            <bridgehead>In VR Juggler</bridgehead>

            <para>Configuration of VR Juggler is much more powerful and
            flexible than what is used by the
            <productname>CAVElibs</productname> software. As a result, it is
            also more complex. All configurable parameters could be in one or
            more files with any names desired. VR Juggler comes with example
            configuration files that may be found in the directory
            <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/configFiles</filename>.</para>

            <para>The VR Juggler configuration system is completely extensible
            and could be used outside of VR Juggler. Indeed, it could be used
            outside of any VR paradigm altogether. Refer to the Configuration
            Guide for more information on configuring VR Juggler.</para>

            <title>Important Notes</title>

            <para>Finally, before we get to the source code, there are some
            important notes about programming VR Juggler applications in
            general. Please read these carefully and refer to the indicated
            chapters for more information as necessary.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Shared Memory</title>

               <para>Unlike the <productname>CAVElibs</productname> software,
               VR Juggler does not have to manage shared memory with other VR
               Juggler instances. Thus, when writing a VR Juggler application,
               memory can be created as in a normal, single-threaded C or C++
               application.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>OpenGL Context-Specific Data</title>

               <para>As a result of the shared memory model described above,
               VR Juggler has different requirements for context-specific data
               than the <productname>CAVElibs</productname> software.
               Information such as display lists and texture objects must be
               managed using context-specific data. A <glossterm
               linkend="gloss.display.context">display context</glossterm> is
               the location to which OpenGL rendering commands draw. Compiled
               OpenGL commands such as display lists do not get shared across
               multiple contexts (or windows), and thus, they must be
               initialized once per display context. In a VR Juggler
               application, these OpenGL initializations must be placed in
               <methodname>vrj::GlApp::contextInit()</methodname>. It is
               called once per display context after each context has become
               active. For a more detailed description of these concepts and a
               tutorial on how to use them, please refer to <xref

            <secondary>porting to VR Juggler</secondary>
         </indexterm>

         <para>In this chapter, we give some methods for porting an
         application written with GLUT to VR Juggler. Throughout, we compare
         and contrast the techniques used by VR Juggler and GLUT, and we
         translate concepts familiar to GLUT programmers into VR Juggler
         terms.</para>

         <section>
            <title>Window Creation and Management</title>

            <para>In VR Juggler, window creation is done behind the scenes
            based on configuration file settings. There are two display types:
            Surface and Simulator. A Surface Display can be put into three
            modes: stereo, right eye, or left eye. Most interesting is the
            stereo mode. Stereo mode requires special hardware to display
            stereo, and it creates the most immersive experience. A Simulator
            Display is special because it emulates an active VR system. It can
            show the all active user head positions and orientation, any
            active devices such as gloves or wands, and any Surface Displays.
            The simulator window is nice for debugging tracking systems and
            for visualizing configured Surface Displays.</para>

            <title>The Initialize, Draw, and Frame Routines</title>

            <bridgehead>In GLUT</bridgehead>

            <para>In GLUT, the initialize, draw, and frame routines are known
            as <glossterm linkend="gloss.callback">callbacks</glossterm>
            implemented with C function pointers. In VR juggler, the
            equivalent routines are <firstterm>called back</firstterm> using
            an application object. An application object is a C++ class that
            defines methods to encapsulate the functionality of the
            application within a single C++ object.</para>

            <itemizedlist>
               <listitem>
                  <para>Draw: OpenGL commands are placed in the draw routine.
                  The callback function is defined by passing a function
                  pointer to <function>glutDisplayFunc()</function>.</para>
               </listitem>

               <listitem>
                  <para>Frame: Operations on application data are done within
                  the frame routine. No OpenGL commands are allowed here
                  because the display window is undefined at this point. The
                  frame function is defined with
                  <function>glutIdleFunc()</function>. This function generally
                  does a <function>glutPostRedisplay()</function> to cause the
                  display callback to be executed.</para>
               </listitem>

               <listitem>
                  <para>Init: There is no callback for initialization. Data
                  initialization is done usually before the application
                  starts. Context initialization is done during the first run
                  of the function set with
                  <function>glutDisplayFunc()</function> (once for each window
                  opened).</para>
               </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <bridgehead>In VR Juggler</bridgehead>

            <para>With VR Juggler, no C function pointers are necessary, but a
            pointer to an application object must be given to the VR Juggler
            kernel. As described in earlier sections of this chapter, the
            first step is to derive a new application class from
            <classname>vrj::GlApp</classname>. For more information on
            application objects, it may be helpful to review <xref
            linkend="chapter.app.basics" />. Briefly, the application class
            definition would appear similar to the following:</para>

            <programlisting>class MyApplication : public vrj::GlApp
{
   ...
};</programlisting>

            <para>The draw, frame, and initialize routine concepts in VR
            Juggler are presented in the following list.</para>

                  <para>Draw: An application's display <quote>callback</quote>
                  function is defined by a new member function called
                  <methodname>draw()</methodname> in the derived class. This
                  is where OpenGL rendering commands such as
                  <function>glBegin()</function>,
                  <function>glVertex()</function>, etc. are placed.</para>

                  <para>Frame: Calculations such as navigation, collision,
                  physics, artificial intelligence, etc. are often placed in

                  member functions:</para>

                  latter is called for each display context in the system.
                  These two member functions are:</para>

            <title>Configuration</title>

            <para>Configuration of GLUT applications is quite different than
            configuration of VR Juggler applications. In particular, VR
            Juggler is much more dynamic because configurations are maintained
            as files separate from the application. In GLUT, the configuration
            must be written into the application somehow. This can lead to
            very static, hard-coded configurations.</para>

            <bridgehead>In GLUT</bridgehead>

            <para>There is no built-in configuration system. All system
            settings are coded using the GLUT API.</para>

            <bridgehead>In VR Juggler</bridgehead>

            <para>VR Juggler has a powerful and flexible configuration system.
            As a result, it is also complex. All configurable parameters could
            be in one or more files with any names desired. VR Juggler comes
            with example configuration files that may be found in the
            directory
            <filename>$VJ_BASE_DIR/share/vrjuggler/data/configFiles</filename>.</para>

            <para>The VR Juggler configuration system is completely extensible
            and could be used outside of VR Juggler. Indeed, it could be used
            outside of any VR paradigm altogether. Refer to the VR Juggler

            configuring VR Juggler.</para>

               <title>Shared Memory</title>

               <para>VR Juggler is multi-threaded, and it uses a shared memory
               model across all threads. Thus, when writing a VR Juggler
               application, memory can be created as in a normal,
               single-threaded C or C++ application. VR Juggler is written
               entirely in C++, and as such, new and delete must be used
               instead of <function>malloc()</function> and
               <function>free()</function>.</para>

               <title>OpenGL Context-Specific Data</title>

               <para>As a result of the shared memory model described above,
               VR Juggler has different requirements for context-specific data
               than GLUT. Information such as display lists and texture
               objects must be managed using context-specific data. A
               <glossterm linkend="gloss.callback">display context</glossterm>
               is the location to which OpenGL rendering commands draw.
               Compiled OpenGL commands such as display lists do not get
               shared across multiple contexts (or windows), and thus, they
               must be initialized once per display context. In a VR Juggler
               application, these OpenGL initializations must be placed in
               <methodname>vrj::GlApp::contextInit()</methodname>. It is
               called once per display context after each context has become
               active. For a more detailed description of these concepts and a
               tutorial on how to use them, please refer to <xref

            <para>VR Juggler is a multi-threaded software system. We have
            built up a cross-platform abstraction for threads and

               <para>The following code example shows the basics of declaring
               the class interface and data members for an application that
               will use context-specific data. This is an extension of the

               the <methodname>contextInit()</methodname> declaration and the

               <para>When considering multi-threaded programming, it is
               important to know that with great power comes great
               responsibility. The power is being able to provide multiple
               threads of control in a single application. The responsibility
               is making sure those threads get along with each other and do
               not step on each other's data. VR Juggler is a multi-threaded
               library which makes it very powerful and very complex.</para>

               <para>As a cross-platform framework, VR Juggler uses an
               internal threading abstraction that provides a uniform
               interface to platform-specific threading implementations. That
               cross-platform interface is available to programmers to make
               applications multi-threaded without tying them to a specific
               operating system's threading implementation.</para>

               <para>The threading interface in VPR is modeled after the POSIX
               thread specification of POSIX.1b (formerly POSIX.4). The main
               difference is that VPR's interface is object-oriented while
               POSIX threads (pthreads) are procedural. The basic principles
               are exactly the same, however. A function (or class method) is
               provided to the <classname>vpr::Thread</classname> class, and
               that function is executed in a thread of control that is
               independent of the creating thread.</para>

               <para>Threads are spawned (initialized and begin execution)
               when the <classname>vpr::Thread</classname> constructor is
               called. That is, when instantiating a
               <classname>vpr::Thread</classname> object, a new thread of
               execution is created. The semantics of threads says that a
               thread can begin execution at any time after being created, and
               this is true with <classname>vpr::Thread</classname>s. Do not
               make any assumptions about when the thread will begin running.
               It may happen before or after the constructor returns the
               <classname>vpr::Thread</classname> object. If the thread fails
               to spawn, an exception of type
               <classname>vpr::IllegalArgumentException</classname>,
               <classname>vpr::ResourceException</classname>, or
               <classname>vpr::Exception</classname> is thrown from the

               <para>Passing arguments to threads can done through the thread

               <para>In this section, we explain the concept and use of
               functors. As with much of VR Juggler, a functor is a high-level
               concept that encapsulates something quite simple. A functor is
               defined as <quote>something that performs an operation or a
               function.</quote> While this is not very detailed, it is clear
               and concise. In VPR, functors can be used as the code executed
               by a thread.</para>

               <para>In VPR, a functor is simply another object type that
               happens to encapsulate a user-defined function. The details on
               how this is done are not important here; what is important to
               know is that a functor can be thought of as a normal function.
               When using them, programmers simply implement callable code (a
               free function, a static member function, a non-static member
               function—virtual or non-virtual, or a class that overloads
               <function>operator()</function>) and then pass a reference to
               the callable to the
               <classname>boost::function&lt;T&gt;</classname> constructor.
               Boost.Function does the rest, and it does its job very
               well.</para>

               <para>If the callable code takes parameters, they must be bound
               to the functor instance using
               <function>boost::bind()</function>.
               <function>boost::bind()</function> creates a new functor with a
               different signature than the original. For thread functors, the
               functor signature must match the Boost.Function type
               <classname>boost::function&lt;void()&gt;</classname> (or the
               portable form
               <classname>boost::function0&lt;void&gt;</classname>). The C
               type is <type>void(*)()</type>. No matter how we say it, this
               means a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.
               With <function>boost::bind()</function>, however, we can have
               our thread functor take any number of arguments. Indeed,
               <function>boost::bind()</function> is required to use a class
               member function as a thread functor, and we will get back to
               that case shortly.</para>

               <para>First, let us look at some examples of creating thread
               functors. In the first example (<xref
               linkend="example.functor.free.function" />), we have two free
               functions and a class that creates threads to call those
               functions. The first function,
               <function>threadFunc()</function>, takes no arguments. The
               creation of the <classname>vpr::Thread</classname> object
               assigned to <varname>mThread0</varname> in
               <function>MyClass::startThreads()</function> is therefore very
               simple. The second function,
               <function>threadFuncArgs()</function> takes two arguments: a
               constant 32-bit integer and a reference to a vector of 32-bit
               integers. In this case, we have to use
               <function>boost::bind()</function> to bind function parameter
               to the functor. Notice that the vector is passed by reference,
               and we have to use <function>boost::ref()</function> (declared
               in <filename>boost/ref.hpp</filename>) to indicate this fact.
               Otherwise, <varname>mResults</varname> would be copied into the
               functor object, and no results would ever be available to the
               instance of <classname>MyClass</classname>. For objects that
               are to be passed by constant reference, use
               <function>boost::cref()</function>.</para>

               <para>Now, we have what is likely to be the most common usage
               of <classname>vpr::Thread</classname>. Namely, the use of a
               non-static class member function as the thread functor. In
               <xref linkend="example.functor.nonstatic.member" />, we see how
               <function>boost::bind()</function> is used to make the functor

               of <classname>vpr::Thread</classname> usage is almost identical
               to that shown in <xref
               linkend="example.functor.static.member" />. The key differences
               are the lack of the static keyword and the use of
               <function>boost::bind()</function>. Remember that
               <function>boost::bind()</function> can be used for passing
               arguments into the function executed in the spawned thread, so
               we can combine ideas from the free functions example (<xref
               linkend="example.functor.free.function" />) with the binding of
               the <varname>this</varname> variable to the non-static member
               function. Simply put the arguments to be bound after the
               <varname>this</varname> parameter in the call to

               <para>What we have not yet seen is how to handle the case of a

               <para>The most important part of multi-threaded programming is
               proper thread synchronization so that access to shared data is
               controlled. Doing so results in consistency among all threads.
               Semaphores are a very common synchronization mechanism and have
               been used widely in concurrent systems. This short section
               describes the cross-platform semaphore interface provided with
               and used by VPR. It does not explain what semaphores are or how
               to use them—it is assumed that readers are already familiar
               with the topic lest they probably would not be reading this
               chapter on advanced classes at all.</para>

               <para>As with threads, a cross-platform abstraction layer has
               been written into VPR to provide a consistent way to use
               semaphores on all supported platforms. The primary goal behind
               the interface design is to provide the common
               <emphasis>P</emphasis> (acquire) and <emphasis>V</emphasis>
               (release) operations. A given semaphore controls access to
               <emphasis>n</emphasis> resources. Thus, n threads can acquire a
               semaphore without blocking, but the <emphasis>n</emphasis> + 1
               attempt to acquire the semaphore will block until a resource
               release occurs. The interface does include methods for
               read/write semaphores, but as of this writing, that part of the
               interface is not complete.</para>

               <para>In addition to cross-platform semaphores, VPR provides an
               abstraction for cross-platform mutexes. Mutexes are a special
               type of semaphore known as a binary semaphore. Exactly one
               thread can hold the lock at any time. This very short section,
               however, is not about mutexes but rather about the
               <classname>vpr::Mutex</classname> interface provided with VPR
               and used by VR Juggler.</para>

               <para>The cross-platform mutex abstraction in VPR is critical
               for synchronizing access to shared data. Those who have read
               the section on <classname>vpr::Semaphore</classname><indexterm>

                     <secondary>vpr::Semaphore</secondary>
                  </indexterm> will find this section very, very familiar. The
               interface for <classname>vpr::Mutex</classname> is a subset of
               that for <classname>vpr::Semaphore</classname> since mutexes
               are binary semaphores. In other words, they control access to
               exactly one resource. They can be locked and unlocked. That is
               all there is to know. The <classname>vpr::Mutex</classname>
               interface does include some methods for read/write mutexes, but
               this implementation is incomplete and is not documented here
               for that reason. When the implementation is finished, this
               documentation will be expanded.</para>

            <para>In the reader exercise from <xref

            use of mutexes to protect access to the data modified in
            <methodname>intraFrame()</methodname> and rendered in
            <methodname>draw()</methodname>. When the mesh is rendered, some
            tearing will almost certainly be seen. This happens as a result of
            data changing during the rendering of the data. In other words,
            access to a <glossterm linkend="gloss.critical.section">critical
            section</glossterm> of code not being controlled. To prevent
            tearing, we need to protect the internal mesh data. However, using
            a mutex to control access to the mesh will result in the
            computation and rendering being serialized. In so doing, we lose
            the value of parallelizing the computation and rendering.</para>

               <para>To work around this, we can use multiple buffers. More
               specifically, we will use three buffers: one for reading, one
               for writing, and one as temporary storage of the most recently
               completed write(s). This is called <glossterm
               linkend="gloss.triple.buffering">triple buffering</glossterm>,
               and it allows us to perform computation and rendering in
               parallel without causing one process to wait on the other. The
               rendering buffer can be accessed without locking, as can the
               computation buffer. The only time a lock must be held is when
               the latest computations are copied into the temporary storage
               buffer or when the contents of the temporary storage buffer are
               copied into the rendering buffer. Thus, the key to triple
               buffering is the temporary storage buffer.</para>

               <para>Implementing triple buffering is relatively
               straightforward, once the basic idea is understood. For this
               discussion we will refer to the buffers as follows:</para>

               <orderedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para><firstterm>Stable</firstterm>: The buffer from
                     which the most recent data will be read</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                     <para><firstterm>Working</firstterm>: The buffer into
                     which the current data will be written</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                     <para><firstterm>Working Copy</firstterm>: The buffer
                     used to store the last completed write results
                     temporarily</para>
                  </listitem>
               </orderedlist>

               <para>Of the three, Working Copy is the only one that is shared
               between the threads, and thus, only one mutex must be used. The
               mutex must be locked when swapping the contents of Stable and
               Working Copy and when swapping the contents of Working and
               Working Copy. No lock must be held when reading from Stable or
               when writing to Working. This is where the major benefit of
               triple buffering is realized.</para>

               <para>In the thread that will write to Working, the
               implementation will follow this basic structure:</para>

               <programlisting>while ( KeepWriting )
{
   Write to Working

   Lock Working Copy mutex
      Swap Working and Working Copy
   Unlock Working Copy mutex
}</programlisting>

               <para>In the thread that will read from Stable, the
               implementation is (roughly) the reverse:</para>

               <programlisting>while ( KeepReading )
{
   Lock Working Copy mutex
      Swap Stable and Working Copy
   Unlock Working Copy mutex

   Read from Stable
}</programlisting>

               </indexterm>

               <para>It is possible to optimize triple buffering to reduce the
               amount of time spent in the locked section. Instead of swapping
               the buffers, we can swap the pointers to the buffers. The
               result is that we only have to swap (up to) eight bytes of
               memory, regardless of the size of the actual data.</para>

               <para>A very simple way to implement this is to use a
               three-element array to hold the buffers and three variables to
               use as the indices into the array. The variables can be named
               <varname>stable</varname>, <varname>working</varname>, and
               <varname>working_copy</varname>, for example. All accesses into
               the array of buffers use one of those three values. In other
               words, the thread reading from Stable will use
               <varname>buffer[stable]</varname> to get its buffer. Similarly,
               the thread writing to Working will use
               <varname>buffer[working]</varname>. Swapping the buffers simply
               involves changing the values of <varname>stable</varname> and
               <varname>working_copy</varname> or <varname>working</varname>
               and <varname>working_copy</varname>.</para>

               <para>In the thread that will perform the writing, the
               pseudo-code for swapping is as follows:</para>

               <programlisting>Lock Working Copy mutex
   temp = working
   working = working_copy
   working_copy = working
Unlock Working Copy Mutex</programlisting>

               <para>Similarly, in the thread that will perform the reading,
               the pseudo-code for swapping is as follows:</para>

               <programlisting>Lock Working Copy mutex
   temp = stable
   stable = working_copy
   working_copy = stable
Unlock Working Copy Mutex</programlisting>

               <para>In these examples, it takes three memory copies to swap
               the two values. Use of the temporary storage is required (at
               the C/C++ level), and thus, swapping the memory cannot be done
               any faster, regardless of the size of the data buffers.</para>

               </indexterm>

               <para>Triple buffering can be used in VR Juggler applications
               in two ways: in <methodname>intraFrame()</methodname> or in a
               separate thread. In both cases, the operations will happen
               asynchronously to the <methodname>draw()</methodname> thread,
               so the uses are <emphasis>roughly</emphasis> equivalent. Using
               <methodname>intraFrame()</methodname> is easier than creating a
               separate thread because the parallel processing comes
               <quote>for free</quote> with
               <methodname>intraFrame()</methodname>. No special actions must
               be taken on the part of the application developer. Programmers
               must keep in mind, however, that if the computations will take
               longer than the rendering, the application frame rate will
               drop. This is because the next frame cannot start until after
               <methodname>intraFrame()</methodname> completes. Thus, using a
               thread will increase the complexity of the application code
               somewhat, but it will ensure that the frame rate will not be
               adversely affected.</para>

               <para>In this tutorial, we will use MPApp again to do parallel
               computation and rendering. This time, however, we will use
               triple-buffered, protected data instead of simply writing in

               (simultaneously) in <methodname>draw()</methodname>. It will be

               that no changes made for the previous tutorial affect this
               exercise.</para>

               <para>Using the information presented earlier in this section,
               the exercise is to extend the <classname>Mesh</classname> class
               (found in <filename>Mesh.h</filename>) so that it uses triple
               buffering for computation and rendering. It is up to the reader
               to decide whether to use threads (refer to the documentation

            <para>There are four steps involved in adding run-time
            reconfiguration to a VR Juggler application. We describe each of
            them in detail here in the following subsections.</para>

            <section>
               <title>Create Application-Specific Configuration
               Definitions</title>

               <para>The first step in adding dynamic reconfiguration
               capabilities to an application is to decide what aspects of the
               application should be configurable. Naturally, this is very
               application-specific, but some of the following choices are
               common:</para>

               <itemizedlist>
                  <listitem>
                     <para>Initial parameters (position, color, etc.) of
                     objects in the environment</para>

                     <para>Navigational position</para>
                  </listitem>

                  <listitem>
                     <para>Global settings such as difficulty level of a game,
                     or network settings for a distributed application</para>
                  </listitem>
               </itemizedlist>

               <para>Once decisions are made regarding configuration
               information, it is time to define the kinds of configuration
               elements that will contain it. This essentially means creating
               a file containing one or more configuration definitions. To
               understand this better, consider the following example. One
               might define an <quote>Object</quote> definition in an
               application. The definition would have properties that include
               the name and type of an object, its color and size, and so
               forth.</para>

               <para>There are several ways to ensure that custom
               configuration definitions are read by the application. One way
               is to load the definition file explicitly (described below),
               but the simplest way is to include the custom definition file
               from one of the configuration files the application loads at
               startup. Instructions for editing configuration definition
               files and creating new kinds of definitions are included in the
               <emphasis>VRJConfig User's Guide</emphasis>.</para>

               <title>Implement the Dynamic Reconfiguration Interface</title>

               <para>The next step is to implement the dynamic reconfiguration
               interface for the application object. This interface is defined

                     <para>This method is called whenever an element is added
                     to the application, whether by loading a configuration
                     file or through a dynamic reconfiguration event. Prior to
                     this, the element will have been passed through the
                     application object's
                     <methodname>configCanHandle()</methodname> method. Thus,
                     when <methodname>configAdd()</methodname> is called, the
                     element is destined for the application object.</para>

                     <para>When <methodname>configAdd()</methodname> is
                     called, the application should look at the element passed
                     to it and decide what to do. This might involve creating
                     a new object, changing the configuration of an extant
                     object, changing the values of certain variables, or any
                     number of other possibilities. This flexibility is part
                     of the power of dynamic reconfiguration with VR

                     <para>This method is analogous to
                     <methodname>configAdd()</methodname>. It is called when
                     VR Juggler receives a command to remove a particular
                     configuration element. If the element refers to a
                     specific object in the application, the most obvious
                     behavior would be to remove that particular object. If
                     the element refers to some other properties of the
                     application, there are several choices for the correct
                     behavior. For example, one might choose to reset those
                     properties to their default values. In some cases, it may
                     be desirable or necessary to ignore the remove
                     request.</para>

               <title>Procesing Configuration Elements</title>

               <para>When an application receives a configuration element to
               process via <methodname>configAdd()</methodname> or
               <methodname>configRemove()</methodname>, it needs to retrieve
               the data in that element in order to decide what to do.
               Configuration elements can be very complex, but the interface
               has been designed to be as simple as possible. We now describe
               a few of the most important methods in the
               <classname>jccl::ConfigElement</classname> API.</para>

                     </indexterm>

                     <para>This method returns the token of the configuration
                     definition which describes this element. This is useful
                     if an application uses several kinds of custom element
                     types. With this method, it is possible to distinguish
                     one from another.</para>

                     </indexterm>

                     <para>This is the key method for getting the information
                     contained in a configuration element. Its arguments are
                     the token associated with a property and a numeric index.
                     For example, a property might store a coordinate with
                     three values, each of which can be accessed separately by
                     using the numbers 0, 1, or 2 for the
                     <varname>num</varname> parameter.</para>

                     <para>The return value and the template parameter for
                     this method need some explanation. Basically, the return
                     value of <methodname>getProperty()</methodname> is cast
                     to whichever type the caller expects to receive. This
                     type is named using the template paramter. (It is assumed
                     that the caller knows the types of values stored in a
                     given property.) The use of the template paramter allows
                     any type to be used through the type-specific
                     specialization performed by the C++ compiler. The
                     following code fragment gives a few examples of this
                     usage:</para>

                     <programlisting>std::string s1 = element-&gt;getProperty&lt;std::string&gt;("name", 0);

bool b = element-&gt;getProperty&lt;bool&gt;("enabled");
std::string s3 = element-&gt;getProperty&lt;std::string&gt;("enabled");
// s3 will be one of the strings "0" or "1"

jccl::ConfigElementPtr elt =
   element-&gt;getProperty&lt;jccl::ConfigElementPtr&gt;("child_element", 2);</programlisting>

                     <para>Sometimes properties of a configuration element can
                     have a variable number of values. A good example is a
                     property that lists a set of files to be loaded. The
                     <methodname>getNum()</methodname> method returns the
                     actual number of values of the named property.</para>

                  <para>Readers unfamiliar with the JCCL terminology should
                  refer to the JCCL documentation. We will not attempt to give
                  a full explanation of how JCCL works here.</para>
               </note>

               <para>In the example application ConfigApp, we will see how to
               configure the color of the ground in the 3D scene using JCCL.
               The configuration is based on a configuration element
               definition that defines four properties, each with three
               values. The ground is defined as a rectangular polygon, and
               each property corresponds to one of the corners of the
               rectangle. The values of the property are the red, green, and
               blue values for the color of the corresponding corner
               vertex.</para>

               <para>In <xref linkend="example.config_app.jdef" />, we show
               all of <filename>config_app.jdef</filename>. This contains many
               key pieces of information. The <quote>name</quote> attribute
               defines the type of the configuration element(s) that will
               appear in a configuration file. In our case, our config element
               type is <quote>config_app.</quote> Under the
               <sgmltag>definition_version</sgmltag> tag, the category for our
               configuration element is defined to be
               <quote>Application.</quote> This is done to indicate that this
               is an application-specific configuration definition. Finally,
               we see the property description for the corner colors, each of
               which has three floating-point values. The values have defaults
               of 1.0 for red, 0.0 for green, and 0.0 for blue. As such, the
               lower left corner vertex color defaults to red. The property
               definitions for the other three corners are similar.</para>

               <para>Using this configuration definition, we can create an
               instance of our configuration type in a configuration file. An
               example instance is shown in <xref
               linkend="example.ConfigApp.jconf" />. Here, we see the
               configuration for all four corners of the rectangular ground
               polygon. Note also that no special steps have to be taken in
               the configuration file to load the definition file. This is
               handled automatically by the JCCL Configuration Manager as long
               as the environment variable
               <envar>$JCCL_DEFINITION_PATH</envar> includes the directory
               where <filename>config_app.jdef</filename> sits. A typical way
               of setting this environment variable for this application would

               <title>The <methodname>configCanHandle()</methodname> Member
               Function</title>

               <para>The implementation of
               <methodname>configCanHandle()</methodname> is located in
               <filename>ConfigApp.cpp</filename>. It will be invoked whenever
               a new configuration element is found, and its job is to tell
               the JCCL Configuration Manager if it can be handled or not. The
               full implementation is as follows:</para>

               <programlisting>bool ConfigApp::configCanHandle(jccl::ConfigElementPtr element)
{
   const std::string my_type("config_app");
   return my_type == element-&gt;getID();
}</programlisting>

               <para>We define the element type that the application knows how
               to handle (named <quote>ConfigApp</quote>, as shown above), and
               we return <constant>true</constant> if that type matches the
               type of the newly loaded configuration element.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title>The <methodname>configAdd()</methodname> Member
               Function</title>

               <para>When a configuration element matching our type is loaded,
               the method <methodname>configAdd()</methodname> is invoked. The
               parameter passed in is the full configuration element that was
               loaded. The job of <methodname>configAdd()</methodname> is to
               read the information from the configuration element and
               configure the application based on what is read. In this
               specific case, we will read color information used for coloring
               the ground polygon in the scene. A partial implementation of
               <methodname>ConfigApp::configAdd()</methodname> follows:</para>

               <programlisting>bool ConfigApp::configAdd(jccl::ConfigElementPtr element)
{
   const std::string ll_color("lower_left_color");

   // Get the color settings for the lower left corner (ll).
   for ( int i = 0; i &lt; element-&gt;getNum(ll_color); ++i )
   {
      mSurfaceColor_ll[i] = element-&gt;getProperty&lt;float&gt;(ll_color, i);
   }

   // Get the color settings for the other three corners ...
}</programlisting>

               <para>Note that we are reading the values from the property
               named <quote>lower_left_color.</quote> While we know that there
               are three (3) values to read, we ask the configuration how many
               values it has just to be safe.</para>

               <title>The <methodname>draw()</methodname> Member

               <para>For this application, the draw() member function is not
               terribly interesting. It renders the ground, and the colors for
               the four vertices are set using the member variables. Of
               course, the values for these member variables are set using the
               configuration file, and that is the interesting aspect.</para>

         <title>Advanced Topics</title>

         <para>In this chapter, we address topics that are considered to be
         for advanced uses of VR Juggler. This is not to say that they are
         difficult concepts or hard-to-use features. Rather, they are not
         things that the average VR Juggler application programmer will do or
         even need to be aware of when writing VR software. These are
         important, interesting, and worthwhile topics nonetheless.</para>

         <section id="section.custom.delegate">
            <title>Making a Custom <classname>NSApplication</classname>
            Delegate on Mac OS X</title>

            <para>The Cocoa support for VR Juggler is designed to take
            advantage of the flexibility of Cocoa application design and, more
            generally, the flexibility of the Objective-C language.
            Specifically, VR Juggler application programmers targeting Mac OS
            X have a unique opportunity to customize the behavior of VR
            Juggler application behavior. Behind the scenes,
            <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> registers a delegate, an
            instance of the Objective-C class
            <classname>VRJBasicDelegate</classname>, with the
            <classname>NSApplication</classname> singleton. Messages from
            <classname>NSApplication</classname> are received and handled by
            this object. VR Juggler application programmers can tailor the
            handling of these messages by creating and using a custom
            <classname>NSApplication</classname> delegate.</para>

            <para>The full details of delegates and customizing the behavior
            of <classname>NSApplication</classname> are well beyond the scope
            of this document. Readers are referred to Apple's documentation
            for <ulink
            url="http://developer.apple.com/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/GS_Cocoa/index.html">Cocoa</ulink>
            and <ulink
            url="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html"><classname>NSApplication</classname>
            class reference</ulink>. We will proceed from here under the
            assumption that readers are already familiar with the relevant and
            necessary topics including, but not limited to, Objective-C,
            Objective-C++, and <classname>NSApplication</classname>.</para>

            <para>In a typical Cocoa application, the delegate would be given
            to the <classname>NSApplication</classname> singleton instance by
            sending that object the<methodname>-setDelegate:</methodname>
            message. Doing so, however, will interfere with the proper
            functionality of VR Juggler. Thus, the registration mechanism is
            done using the <literal>VRJDelegateClass</literal> property in
            <filename>Contents/Resources/vrjuggler.plist</filename>. The
            default value of this property is
            <classname>VRJBasicDelegate</classname>. By changing this to the
            name of the custom class, <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname>
            will instantiate, register, and use the custom class instead.
            (Being able to do this is a simple and elegant feature of
            Objective-C.)</para>

            <para>There are two ways to create a custom delegate class. The
            class can either stand on its own as a subclass of
            <classname>NSObject</classname>, or it can derive from
            <classname>VRJBasicDelegate</classname>. The decision about which
            approach to use depends on whether complete or partial
            customization is desired. For this discussion, we will focus on
            complete customization—that is, creating a new delegate type by
            deriving from <classname>NSObject</classname>.</para>

            <sidebar>
               <para>It is worth pointing out that
               <classname>VRJBasicDelegate</classname> is not necessarily
               designed to be extended. It can be customized, but mainly, this
               customization is done by overriding methods to
               <emphasis>replace</emphasis> the behavior of the base class
               rather than to extend it. Refer to the implementation of
               <classname>VRJBasicDelegate</classname> to get a better idea of
               the implications of overriding it for the purposes of
               customization. The code can be found in
               <filename>modules/vrjuggler/vrj/Kernel/VRJBasicDelegate.mm</filename>
               and
               <filename>modules/vrjuggler/vrj/Kernel/VRJBasicDelegate.h</filename>.</para>
            </sidebar>

            <para>As noted, the job of the delegate is to respond to messages
            from <classname>NSApplication</classname>. The messages that are
            delivered to the delegate are documented in the
            <classname>NSApplication</classname> reference, and we will not
            duplicate that information here. Instead, we will concentrate on a
            small subset of these messages related to document loading. The
            purpose is twofold. First, this explanation helps in understanding
            the implementation of <classname>VRJBasicDelegate</classname>,
            thereby clarifying options for customizing the behavior of that
            class. Second, document loading is a prominent topic in Mac OS X
            application development, and it is likely to be of the most
            interest to VR application programmers, too.</para>

            <para>To get things under way, have a glance at <xref
            linkend="example.basic.delegate.impl" />. It is a relatively
            simple class that uses Objective-C++ capabilities to create a
            simple bridge between <filename>NSApplication</filename> and
            <classname>vrj::Kernel</classname>. The documents being loaded in
            this case are VR Juggler configuration files, but it is not much
            of a leap to imagine the use of any other document type (i.e.,
            data file used as input to the application). We will review each
            of the methods of this class.</para>

               <para>The class <classname>MyDelegate</classname> has a single
               data member, <varname>mLoadConfigs</varname>, that determines

               changed if <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> sends the
               <methodname>-setLoadConfigs:</methodname> message as a result
               of the property <literal>VRJConfigHandling</literal> being set

            </section>

            <section>
               <title>Designated Initializer</title>

               <para>Every <classname>NSObject</classname> subclass has a
               designated initializer. In the case of the VR Juggler
               <classname>NSApplication</classname> delegate, this is the
               basic <methodname>-init</methodname> method. The current usage
               of the application delegate requires that this method be the
               designated initializer, meaning that it is the only initializer
               that will be invoked upon creating the delegate instance. This
               limitation may be fixed in a future version of
               <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname>. If the custom
               delegate does not accept the -init message, then the inherited
               <classname>NSObject</classname> version will be used.</para>

               <para>In the meantime, this is where all object initialization
               takes place. What this means exactly is up to the delegate
               author. In this case, we set the data member
               <varname>mLoadConfigs</varname> to <constant>YES</constant>,
               send our base class the <methodname>-init</methodname> message,
               and return the result. This last step (a widely used
               convention) is what must be done by any custom delegate
               implementation of <methodname>-init</methodname>.</para>
            </section>

            <section>
               <title><methodname>-setLoadConfigs:</methodname></title>

               <para>This method is a unique aspect of the delegate as it is
               handled by <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname>.
               Specifically, <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> will
               examine <filename>Contents/Resources/vrjuggler.plist</filename>
               to see if it contains the property
               <literal>VRJConfigHandling</literal>. If it does, it will send
               this message to the delegate instance with the value as it is
               set in the property list. This happens before the delegate
               object is handed off to the
               <classname>NSApplication</classname> singleton. The
               consequences of setting and using the
               <literal>VRJConfigHandling</literal> property were described in
               <xref linkend="section.cocoa.app.execution" />.</para>

               <para>A custom delegate does not have to implement this method.
               If it does not, the Objective-C runtime will print a warning on
               the console stating that the object does not receive this
               message. (A future version of
               <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> may examine the
               delegate interface to determine if it receives the message just
               to avoid having that message printed.) It is up to the delegate
               author to determine if implementing this method is necessary
               and, if so, how it should behave. In our example, we set
               <varname>mLoadConfigs</varname> to the value of the parameter,
               just as <classname>VRJBasicDelegate</classname> does.</para>

               <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname>, it is critical that
               this method return the value <constant>NO</constant>. The VR

               <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> and knows how to shut
               it down when the time is right. Because of that, we want the

               <para>Now, we get to one of the methods used by
               <classname>NSApplication</classname> to tell its delegate when
               to open a single data file. Remember that our simple delegate
               just handles VR Juggler configuration files. Moreover, it is
               assuming (probably unsafely) that the only files that it will
               be given to load are VR Juggler configuration files.</para>

               <para>In any case, <classname>NSApplication</classname> sends
               this message to its delegate at well-defined times. The
               response of our simple delegate is based on the value of
               <varname>mLoadConfigs</varname>. If it is true (set to
               <constant>YES</constant>), that means that our delegate will
               load configuration files as a result of the user
               double-clicking on <filename>.jconf</filename> files in the
               <application>Finder</application> or through the use of the
               <command>open</command> command. Loading of configuration files
               is done through the usual means of passing the file name to the
               <classname>vrj::Kernel</classname> instance. Note that we
               convert the <classname>NSString</classname> Unicode value to a
               UTF8 string because that is what
               <methodname>vrj::Kernel::loadConfigFile()</methodname> knows
               how to handle. A future version of VR Juggler may have proper
               Unicode support so that this step is not necessary.</para>

               <para>Note that this method returns <constant>YES</constant>
               regardless of the value of <varname>mLoadConfigs</varname>.
               This has the effect of making
               <classname>NSApplication</classname> think that the file was
               loaded even if it was ignored. In some cases, it may make more
               sense to return <constant>NO</constant> instead. As with just
               about everything in the custom delegate, the exact response to
               this message is up to the author.</para>

               <para>This method is the multi-file counterpart to
               <methodname>-application:openFile:</methodname>. The behavior
               is essentially the same except that it iterates over the
               contents of the given NSArray object and calls
               <methodname>vrj::Kernel::loadConfigFile()</methodname> for each
               of the contained <classname>NSString</classname>
               objects.</para>

            <title>Defining Custom Cocoa/VR Juggler Bridging on Mac OS
            X</title>

            <para>More intrepid programmers may find that writing a custom
            NSApplication delegate is not sufficient for customizing VR
            Juggler application behavior on Mac OS X. In that event, the
            customization can be even more extensive by replacing the use of
            <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> altogether. For all
            intents and purposes, <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> is
            grafted on to <classname>vrj::Kernel</classname> to provide the
            mediator between the competing desires of
            <classname>NSApplication</classname> and
            <classname>vrj::Kernel</classname> to control application
            execution<footnote>
                  <para>This is not a strictly accurate description of the
                  design because <classname>vrj::Kernel</classname> has to
                  know about <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> and call
                  its methods at certain times. A true mediator would sit
                  above <classname>vrj::Kernel</classname> and
                  <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> and coordinate
                  their interaction to prevent such tight coupling, but
                  introducing that sort of design would complicate things
                  unnecessarily.</para>
               </footnote>. <classname>vrj::Kernel</classname> can be told not
            to use <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname>, thus providing an
            extension point where a different Cocoa/VR Juggler bridging can be
            used. This is done by calling the static method
            <methodname>vrj::Kernel::setUseCocoaWrapper()</methodname> with
            the parameter <constant>false</constant>
            <emphasis>before</emphasis> the first call to
            <methodname>vrj::Kernel::instance()</methodname>.</para>

            <para>In general, the programmer of this bridging code is free to
            do whatever makes sense, but there are a few caveats. First, every
            thread that is created by any Juggler component needs to have an
            <classname>NSAutoReleasePool</classname> created. This is done by
            registering thread start and thread exit methods with
            <classname>vpr::Thread</classname>.</para>

            <para>Next, AppKit and Cocoa need to know that they are being used
            in a multi-threaded environment. They are made aware of this fact
            when the first <classname>NSThread</classname> object is created.
            VPR uses low-level POSIX threads on Mac OS X rather than using
            <classname>NSThread</classname>. Thus, a dummy thread needs to be
            created using <classname>NSThread</classname>. All it has to do is
            run an empty method and exit. The thread start callback is
            registered using
            <methodname>vpr::Thread::addThreadStartCallback()</methodname>,
            and the thread exit callback is registered using
            <methodname>vpr::Thread::addThreadExitCallback()</methodname>. The
            thread start callback must allocate and initialize a
            thread-specific instance of
            <classname>NSAutoReleasePool</classname>, and the thread exit
            callback must release its reference to the
            <classname>NSAutoReleasePool</classname> instance created by the
            thread start callback. These callbacks have to be registered
            <emphasis>before</emphasis> any <classname>vpr::Thread</classname>
            objects are created.</para>

            <para>Finally, the global window lock must be held until it is
            safe to open input and graphics windows. This is necessary because
            Gadgeteer and VR Juggler open windows in threads other than the
            primordial, and AppKit does not handle that well. This lock (an
            instance of <classname>NSConditionLock</classname>) is retrieved
            using the static method
            <methodname>gadget::InputAreaCocoa::getWindowLock()</methodname>.
            The job of the bridging code is to acquire the lock as soon as it
            can. Specifically, it should do it <emphasis>before</emphasis>
            creating the <classname>NSApplication</classname> singleton object
            by sending the <classname>NSApplication</classname> class the
            <methodname>+sharedApplication</methodname> message.</para>

            <para>Beyond that, the programmer is free to do as s/he wishes in
            the implementation of the Cocoa/VR Juggler bridging code.
            Referring to the implementation of
            <classname>vrj::CocoaWrapper</classname> is highly recommended
            (see
            <filename>modules/vrjuggler/vrj/Kernel/CocoaWrapper.mm</filename>
            and
            <filename>modules/vrjuggler/vrj/Kernel/CocoaWrapper.h</filename>
            in the source tree), but its exact behavior does not have to be
            replicated. The points presented above are the most important
            things that must be done by any implementation of bridging
            code.</para>

            <para>Ultimately, all of this work is done to help VR Juggler get
            along with Cocoa. VR Juggler makes heavy use of multi-threading
            whereas AppKit and Cocoa tend to work best in single-threaded
            environments—or at in least environments where the primordial
            thread is receiving and dispatching all window system events.
            Things are just not that simple with VR Juggler, and thus the
            bridge between these frameworks plays a vital role.</para>

               <para>An extension to double buffering that uses three data

               one thread will wait while another thread copies no more than
               four bytes of data. That is, regardless of the size of a single
               data buffer, the amount of memory copied to swap buffers is no
               more than four bytes (the size of a 32-bit memory
               address).</para>

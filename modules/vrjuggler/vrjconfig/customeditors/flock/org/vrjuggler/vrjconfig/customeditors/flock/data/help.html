   <h2>Flock of Birds&reg; configuration steps:</h2>

      <h3><u><b>Hardware Settings</b></u></h3>
      
      <h4>Serial Port</h4>
      Set the serial port to which the Flock of Birds is connected.

      <h4>Baud</h4>
      Set the baud for the serial port.

      <h4>Hemisphere</h4>
      Set the hemisphere of the transmitter within which the user(s) will
      be operating.

      <h4>Master Address</h4>
      Set the Fast Bird Bus (FBB) address of the master bird.  This is
      determined by the DIP switch settings on the birds.  With EPROM
      version 3.67 or newer, this value will be detected automatically by
      the device driver.  Otherwise, it must be set correctly here.

      <h4>Addressing Mode</h4>
      Set the addressing mode.  This will depend on the type of Flock
      hardware being used.  With EPROM verrsion 3.67 or newer, this value
      will be detected automatically by the device driver.  Otherwise, it
      must be set correctly here.

      <h4>Filter</h4>
      Set the filter.  This value is currently <i>ignored</i> by the device
      driver.

      <h4>Device Host</h4>
      <i>CLUSTER ONLY</i>: Set the cluster node where the Flock of
      Birds&reg; is physically attached.  This determines which node
      will run the device driver.

      <h3><u><b>Transmitter Settings</b></u></h3>

      <p>
      Under the <b>Transmitter</b>, you will find the settings for the
      placement of the Flock of Birds&reg; transmitter (a small white cube
      or a big, heavy black box).  The orientation and position of the
      transmitter are configured relative to the VR Juggler coordinate frame.
      Remember that the transmitter coordinate frame has negative X coming
      out of the face with the power cord  and positive Y to the left of the
      front face.  Refer to Page 142 of the <i>Flock of Birds&reg;
      Installation and Operation Guide</i> (910141 Rev A1, published January
      31, 2002).
      </p>

      <p>
      Configure the position and orientation of the Flock of Birds&reg;
      transmitter (the large black box) relative to the VR Juggler
      coordinate frame.  This process configures what is known as a
      "position transform filter."  The panels titled "Orientation" and
      "Position" present an easy way to perform this task.
      </p>

      <h4>Orientatino</h4>
      First, choose the coordinate frame rotation from the
      <b>Transmitter Coordinate Frame</b> list.  To enter the X, Y, and
      Z rotation values directly, click the <b>Manual Entry</b> button
      and fill in the values to the right of the list.

      <h4>Position</h4>
      Next, set the position of the transmitter relative to the
      chosen VR Juggler origin.  The units can be entered as
      meters, centimeters, feet, or inches.  Make sure to pick the
      units before entering the location value.

      <h4>Tracker Units</h4>
      Set the physical units of the data returned by the sensors.
      Currently, the Flock of Birds tracking system <i>only</i> returns
      inches, but the device driver always reinterprets this as
      <b>Feet</b>.  Therefore, <b>Feet</b> must be chosen.
